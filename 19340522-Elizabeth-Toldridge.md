Dear Miss Toldridge:—

................. Glad you like *Celephaïs*—though the printed text had many abominable misprints, including some which seemed to present me in an illiterate light. The tale is an old one—obviously influenced by Dunsany & embodying the fragments of several actual dreams. I have not yet seen a copy of *Marvel Tales* (Barlow lost his before I reached De Land), but hope Crawford will be able to keep the venture going. ..................

No—the contemporary Spanish art shown in Providence was not of the erratic sort known as "modernistic". Artistically, the modern Spaniards (except Picasso) seem to be healthily & refreshingly conservative. ................... Florida proved as attractive as usual—it's almost subtropical scenery having a singular fascination, while my health is braced up enormously by the vivifying warmth. De Land is a pretty town, & nearby is De Leon Springs—with an old sugar mill dating back to the Spanish period before 1763. The Barlow place—spacious, landscaped, & with a fascinating lake in the rear—is 14 miles west of the village, out of sight of any human habitation. Young Barlow—the son of a retired army Colonel—is an infinitely bright boy, & possesses innumerable accomplishments. he is very unfortunately handicapped by poor eyesight. He expects to be in Washington in the autumn—consulting oculists. He & I are having a splendid time—motoring to various points, rowing on the lake behind the house, & having reading, writing, & discussing sessions all over the nearby countryside. His collection of books & magazines pertaining to the weird is valuable & unusual. Not long ago Barlow shot a giant snake, whose skin he is going to use for binding books. The cats & 'possums are delightful!

All good wishes—
