At the Edge of the Voor—  
Hour when the Aklo Colours coruscate.  
Mar. 9, 1934

Dear Klakash-Ton:—

................  
You must not fail to draw me at least sketchy likenesses of Dame Simaetha and Genl. Tabasco—for the more you say of them, the more interested I become! Dwyer has just sent me some fascinating snaps of his black imp-a veritable fragment of the eternal Night! I mentioned them to Count magnus the other day as he crouched on his beloved back-fence, and his answering purrs and rubbings were eloquent of curiosity. But behold! There is news from Ulthar! Not many days ago Mrs. Spotty, the white and black lady at the boarding-house across the back garden (Alfred Galpin's foster-mother of last summer) was delivered of the liveliest and most fascinating set of triplets ever be-held on this side of the River Skai. Eyes just open. Two—both Maltese—are promised to be discriminating ailurophiles elsewhere; but the third—white and black like mamma—will be retained and reared. It is needless to say that I shall do considerable friendly borrowing in the weeks to come, when Little Belknap (as I shall call him) is less dependent on immediate maternal vicinage! I hope he will not follow little Alfred Galpin into the baffling abyss of invisibility! There's a fine black and white feline—Oswald—at Sultan Malik's new habitat!

Thine in The Bond of Pueth—  
E'ch-Pi-El
