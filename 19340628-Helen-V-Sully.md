Dear Helen:—

..........................................................
It would seem to me that the cure for a feeling of oppression like yours—oppression at the thought of inevitable human losses, & the often meaningless ceremonials attending the disposal of mortal remains—ought to lie in an increased sense of *objectivity*, & a heightened realisation of the true proportions of the universe & of the insignificance of mankind & all its affairs therein. There is no need of drugging oneself with immortality myths in order to be tolerably contended during the brief span of one lives. If we had never heard of the extravagant promises of the various religions, & of the sentimentalised conception of human ties based upon these promises, we would not be so disturbed by those inevitable results of change which we know must come to all. There is no reason why anyone should be sure of retaining all the landmarks—either human or non-human—to which one has grown used & of which one has grown fond; so that the realistic analyst accustoms himself from the very first to the idea of tantalising impermanence in every department of life. Parents & friends die; beloved houses & landscapes become hopelessly altered or destroyed; social milieux & other environmental supports decay & become metamorphosed; & one's self grows old, exiled from the beauty, vividness, & adventurous expectancy of youth, & doomed to be a more or less impatiently tolerated onlooker. These are the basic & inescapable we can build certain palliatives or defences against them. Knowing that nothing & nobody is certain of lasting, we can wisely refrain from pinning too much of our old hold on life to any one object—human or otherwise—or limited range of objects. We can cultivate the *sense of pageantry & panorama,* & think of the terrestrial scene in terms of historic movements & races instead of in terms of specific individuals. Not that we need to abandon all kindliness & affection towards individuals; but that we ought to remember how transient & infinitesimal all individuals are, & to avoid making our entire sense of equilibrium & contentment dependent upon the life & proximity of a few definite persons. The stream of race & tradition is deeper, stabler, & more important than the atoms which compose it. Memory & objectivity join hands in making existence a little more tolerable. When we bring ourselves to realise that *time* is only one element in an infinitely complex cosmos, we tend to protest less when something that *is* becomes something that *has been*. The difference between *is-ness* & *has been-ness* tends to vanish—we feel that the mere quality of duration does not amount to so much after all. Why should a thing be *immortal* in time, when the basic fact of its *having existed* is virtually equivalent so far as the larger universe is concerned? The difference between a friend who *has lived* & one who *still lives* is not as vast as one might imagine. Both exist as images in the mind, & may be regarded with equal affection. The same is true of a house or scene or other beloved object or condition. Of course, the change is unfortunate; for a past object does not impinge as responsively on our consciousness as a present one; but philosophy teaches us that certain amount of unfortunateness is absolutely inevitable. When we are all braced to expect, as a matter of course, a certain amount of misfortune, we are infinitely better able to bear it. We know that virtually every pleasant thing must pass—so when one goes, we console ourselves by enjoying the many other pleasant things which are generally left. The greater our philosophic & aesthetic expansion, the more sources of contentment we shall generally be able to find in life. When we lose individual things, the drama of the whole racial pageant is left to us—& so on. And so with the tragedy of personal ageing & of changing milieu. In these matters the great healer is the ability to become predominantly objective—to cease to think about oneself—or one's relation to the surrounding pattern—at all, but to cultivate an impersonal *spectator's* interest in the dramatic seething visible on every hand. What if one's familiar landmarks *are* wasted away? What if one *is* grey & ugly & stranded in the listless, beauty-bereft deserts of age or middle-age? The sense of deprivation in such cases is infinitely lessened by a sort of psychological self-annihilation—a decision that one no longer exists at all except as a spectator, in a darkened auditorium, to an external drama. As soon as one completes this self-annihilation, he can regard the external pageant with genuine interest but little tinged with regret at his own lack of a pleasant connexion with it. Then, too, there is the tremendous refuge offered by pleasant aesthetic & intellectual activities, either creative or appreciative. This boon really has three separate phases, any one of which can be a substantial aid. First, there is the inestimable benefit of *merely being busy* with something which one is able to consider worth doing. When we are busy at anything at all we generally have no time to brood over our misfortunes. Second, our activities are often intrinsically pleasant & satisfying—sometimes poignantly so. And third—a great deal of art & philosophy is consciously & specifically of a consolatory or escape-opening nature. That is especially true of the weird art of which Klarkash-Ton & I are so fond. The real *rason d'être* of that art is to give one a temporary illusion of emancipation from the galling & intolerable tyranny of time; space, change, & natural law. If we can give ourselves even for rather a brief moment the illusory sensation that some law of the ruthless cosmos has been—or could be invalidated or defeated, we acquire a certain flush of triumphant emancipation comparable in its comforting power to the opiate dreams of religion. Indeed, the religion itself is merely a pompous formalisation of fantastic art. Its disadvantage is that it demands an *intellectual* belief in the impossible, while fantastic art does not.

After all—for the average person life is not by any means as bad as it might be. Of course, real *happiness* is only a rare & transient phenomenon; but when we cease to expect this extravagant extreme, we usually find a very tolerable fund of mild contentment at our disposal. True, people & landmarks vanish, & one grows old & out of the more glamourous possibilities & expectancies of life; but over-against these things there remains the fact that the world contains an almost inexhaustible store of objective beauty & potential interest & drama ..... all at the disposal of anyone philosophic enough to go through the process of psychological self-annihilation. To divide one's interests & affections rationally; & to get so interested in the drama of what's going on that one forgets one's own part—or lack of part—in the environing turmoil—those are the secrets of sensible living. We would not resent the inevitable greyness & disappointments of life so much, if religion * sentimentality did not so viciously teach us to expect more. This false teaching of orthodox tradition is something which ought to be done away with— though I hope it can be disposed of without destroying other & really valuable parts of our traditional heritage. To sum up—if one can be sensible & realistic, there's no reason why one shouldn't have a decently good time out of life if one can be sure (as I wish to hades I could!) of an income equivalent to $10.00 a week till death.

Regarding funerals & internments—there are two sides to the matter. On the one hand, it is undeniably appropriate that relatives & friends should have a chance to register their esteem for a deceased person; but on the other hand, the existing ceremonies (conducted over a decomposing corpse which has scant meaning after the *person*— the *mode of motion* in the brain cells—has ceased to exist) are frankly barbaric & superstitious ..... originating in savage rites designed to make cadavers stay put in their graves instead of stalking stiffly among the living by night. To my mind, *cremation* is the only sane & tasteful way to dispose of a body—& it surely ought to be done without publicity or ostentation. A non-religious *memorial service* might in many cases be highly appropriate—but if not sympathetically determined by circumstances, & it certainly ought not to emanate around any material fetish so coarse & unimaginative as an urnful of calcined phosphates or a coffin-full of glassy-eyed nitrogenous carrion mends! However,—life is so trivial at best that it doesn't pay anybody to worry about the ultimate disposal of his bones. What does it matter what happens to the cast-off reliquiae of any one atom in the cosmos? The person himself no longer exists—so the business is of no primary concern to him. They can dump my carcass down the sewer for all I care—I'll be out of it! Of course there is an element of aesthetic appropriateness which may justly give each individual certain wishes in the matter of his final rites, & I heartily endorse the idea of leaving instructions regarding such. I'd advocate cremation, & a non-religious memorial service for family & very close friends only. My point is that the matter isn't really important enough to worry about—especially when one is young & not likely to be a subject of mortuary rites for 60 years or more. I am reminded of an argument with a friend some years ago on the topic of burial—he was only 40 & in good health, but was actually acutely worried about the sort of funeral he would get. Himself a sturdy agnostic, he felt he could not stop his very proper Methodist wife from giving him an orthodox funeral—& the notion preyed upon him. I simply laughed him out of his perplexity with a reiteration of the query "what of it?" Would the irony of such a thing be any greater than any of the numberless ironies & inconsistencies of life? As a rational cynic, conscious that he would not be existing when his wife staged her harmless circus over his reliquiae, he ought to be amused rather than distressed at the prospect. Of course, it would be alright to leave instructions—maybe his wife *would* follow them after all .... & maybe he'd outlive her ..... but surely there was no use in getting excited over trifles ...... & anyhow, he might not die for another forty years! Well—he saw the point, & joined me in my smiles at the matter. He's six years nearer death now, & his wife is still alive & pious, but he doesn't worry any more! he just shrugs his shoulders & leaves the whole thing to Fate—which is, in the last analysis, about all anybody can really do about anything! And so I'd advocate others to do. There are enough worried in life without carrying them over into death. What we don't know won't hurt us! .....

The case of your friend who became a communist is certainly pathetic in the extreme—though it must not be thought that all communistic belief is synonymous with deterioration. Actually, there are many persons of the highest character & most impeccable background who honestly think that a general communistic programme forms the only ultimate solution of the present breakdown of capitalism—a belief which they derive from the abstract & impersonal study of national resources & their distribution; & which does not, of course, necessarily involve any endorsement of the sudden social changes & absurd formal *ideologies* advocated by the orthodox Marxians & discontented European riffraff. Such persons do not wish to see all traditions & settled ways of living ripped up indiscriminately, but they do feel that mankind will not be able to continue its civilisation unless its stagnating inequalities of resources & opportunities are eventually diminished through some far-sighted plan of distribution & some adequate way of enforcing that plan. To them, some sort of communism (in each case suited to the history & traditions of the race involved) seems the only way to enforce a civilization-preserving economic plan—hence they believe it will have to come in the end ..... though without any wholesale repudiation of general folkways & preferably without any violent revolution. The number of these honest & analytical communists or semi-communists seems vastly on the increase, & I cannot but fear that they will play into the hands of the wild & unscrupulous Bolshevik upheavers. But they must not be confused with the disintegrated personalities who revolt savagely against civilization & clamour for a totally new order. These philosophic *communists* are not to be found in Greenwich Village or the ghetto, but in some of the choicest & most dignified American homes—I've just encountered one amongst the most ancient & settled stock of St. Augustine! I don't agree with their equalitarianism, but I have to admit that they are honest theorists rather than morbid emotionalists or savagely atavistic rebels. When a whole economic order is perishing through evolution & changed conditions—as *laissez-faire* capitalism is now doing under the impact of the machine age—it is no wonder that *every* possible substitute is soberly considered by responsible, intelligent, & impersonally far-sighted persons. Thus it is erroneous to fancy that there must be something the matter with anybody who believes in communism—that he must be a criminal, a foreigner, a savage throwback, or a psychopathic case. It is true, of course, that criminals, foreigners, throwbacks, nuts & fools *do* flock to the banners of *any* cause even remotely connected with upheaval & change—since their disorganised & inferiority-conscious minds, so inadequate in *this* civilisation, always have a pitiful feeling that they'd be better off under *some other*—*any* other—regime. But the converse is not true—for there are many sincere advocates of change who are not at all inadequate under the dying order, & who call for modifications not from any personal standpoint, but simply because they perceive that the present system is unable to survive in the long run. They want a new order speedily or gradually installed, so that a general collapse to savage disorganisation & anarchy may be avoided. To sum up the matter, one can't condemn a whole theory or point of view merely because one has encountered some unfortunate or undesirable individuals connected with it. Attitudes & perspectives & race movements are greater than the individuals exemplifying them.

For my part, I hope it will not be necessary to resort to communism; since so much of the communistic programme—including its most culturally destructive parts—wastes its energy on the quest for an *absolute equilitarianism* which is *not in the least necessary for the restoration of economic equilibrium*, & which indeed has many intrinsically undesirable features. Some change *must* come, since in an intensively mechanised world *unsupervised* capitalism leads inevitably to the grotesque cornering of resources, & to an increasingly vast amount of *permanent* unemployment, even in the most *prosperous* times. Belknap is right *thus far*. But to my mind, the gradually modifying influences of a programme of government supervision of wealth & industry—a programme involving *no major social or cultural overturn*, but resembling rather old-time socialism, modern fascism, & the Roosevelt New Deal carried somewhat further—will solve the problem finitely better .... & infinitely less destructively ..... than any new *ideology* or ruthless *proletarian dictatories* could even begin to do. In the case of the United States, I believe that the only way to secure a workable economic order is to begin modifying in a small way, & gradually increase the scope of governmental control before either the crazy old-line Republican "individualists" or the equally crazy modern Bolshevik malcontents can have a chance to wreck the whole works. Just how far it may be necessary to go, nobody can say at the present moment, I fancy the government will eventually have to take over & operate on a nonprofit basis the larger utilities & industries, yet do not see why a small-scale retail capitalism cannot linger on indefinitely. It seems to me that the present administration—despite a few of the errors unavoidable in any programme of experimentation—is moving in exactly the right direction; so that until it exhibits some very contrary tendency, I can be quite accurately set down as a thorough Roosevelt man ..... & this despite the fact that my forbears were without exception Federalists, Whigs, & Republicans in the respective days of those parties (or modifications of a party).

But all this does not, of course, make the case of your friend any less disastrous & pathetic. It seems very clear that she was the victim of an unsettled, ill-adjusted temperament from the start; & that with her, communism was merely an incident in a sort of neurotic revolt against normal surroundings. I doubt if any alien taint in her heredity could be held responsible, since biology does not work in such conveniently explicable channels. It is really more folklore than fact to suppose that all anti-social or anti-cultural tendencies in a person are due to "bad blood" or to a "foreign" or "peasant" heritage. Actually our social and cultural attitudes are infinitely more environmental than hereditary; whilst foreign or peasant blood seldom predisposes one towards any aberration therefrom. If an inferior strain\* in one's ancestry exists, it is much more likely to make one merely stupid or vicious or both—within the accustomed social circle, than to inspire any especial divergence therefrom. In general—& especially in countries where stratification has never been rigid—arbitrary social caste is seldom much of an index to intrinsic superiority or inferiority. Cases of individual deterioration of various kinds (in some purely nervous, in some mental, & in some emotional—producing a wide variety of eccentric, aberrant, & occasionally repulsively anti-social types) occur constantly in the best of families—including the very oldest & most unmixed; so that it is needless to look for a foreign or socially inferior element in any subject's heredity. Indeed—even if such an element did exist, the chances would only slight that that was the real cause of the deterioration. I could cite a pitiful number of cases of personal disintegration which have occurred in households of the most unquestionably fine ancestry—indeed, the most pitiful case of all was one in which heritage involved was the least open to question. Incidentally—when we reflect upon the strong elements of ruthlessness, selfishness, arrogance, & self-indulgence which—together with good manners, taste, intelligence, responsibility, & a certain sense of honour—once formed a typical part of the aristocratic character, we need not wonder at the degenerate specimens now produced by the old families ..... specimens in whom the old instincts of self-gratification & unrestraint are forced by social change to seek new outlets. The wonder is that old-time aristocratic blood does not constitute a definite taint! This is especially true of the very ancient & immemorially ruthless & vicious aristocracies of continental Europe.

\* by that I mean genuinely or biologically inferior—i, e., with definitely malorganised brain-tissue or definitely coarse or twisted emotions.

In most cases, though, I fancy that personal disintegration is caused bvy factors far more real—individual physiological accident, especially as affecting the functioning of the obscure endocrine glands on which most of our emotions & personality depend, & unfortunate accidents of environment caused by lack of understanding of the subject's particular nervous type. In the case of your friend, I'd imagine that she had a badly working nerve & gland system to start with & that she may not have suffered through lack of this scientific application of the best psychological treatment. Probably no *known* method of treatment would have been of any use, so that one may refer the trouble altogether to obscure physiological malformation or malfunctioning. Now while of course hereditary accident—the way the genes & chromosomes of thousands of ancestors known & unknown happened to get juggled in her e especial case—must have had something to do with this trouble, it would be fallacious to attribute the thing to any *specific* hereditary cause such as foreign blood. That's not the way these things work—as we may see by the vast number of similar cases where heredity is unquestioned. All we can say is, that when the countless varieties of germ-plasm that form even the best of us get combined in a certain way—a way absolutely impossible to foresee, even by the strictest eugenist, & therefore absolutely impossible to avoid once in a while—the result is an individual with faulty nerve & gland functioning, & therefore with emotions departing from the race's recognised norm. Other causes of this individual aberration are wholly recent—disease acquired & transmitted by parents or immediate ancestors; congenital malformation of the embryonic or infant subject; physiological accidents to subject involving organic lesions or traumata, & so on. The race will always breed its pitiful odds & ends, & these will always be doubly pitiful when their aberrations are linked with lofty heritage or distinguised in intellectual or aesthetic capacity. We weep at a tragedy like the late Hart Crane—but find a saving grain of comedy when aberration is linked with stolidity or mediocrity, as in the case of my unwashed Drunkard caller of an hour ago. What a piece of work is man!
