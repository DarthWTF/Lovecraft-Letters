My dear Rimel:—

Little Sam Perkins continues to be an important figure in the neighbourhood of 66 College. He was ill a week ago—languid and drooping but is now quite his dynamic little self again. He purrs off and on, but not very steadily. His eyes are turning out to be yellow, and his face is one of the prettiest I have ever seen. Altogether, he is an unimaginably graceful little piece of the night! I've tried to snap him
twice, but shan't know how well or ill I’ve succeeded till the film is developed. You'll be sorry to hear that his big sister Betsey has suddenly disappeared—a very singular thing, since she never went out of the garden and on the streets where she might be run over. The people at the boarding house are quite disconsolate. As for the name—an old lady at the boarding house started the Perks business last February
when Betsey and her two brothers were born. For some reason or other—perhaps because "Perkins" has a kind of quaint, old-fashioned sound—she named the black and white kitten "Betsey Perkins", though leaving the others (slated for presentation to a family across the city) undesignated. I, however, called the little fellows "Newman Perkins" and "Ebenezer Perkins" after ancestors of my own—for I have a Perkins line. When the black kitten appeared, I went back along my Perkins ancestry and called him Samuel, after a forebear who fought in King Philip's War in 1676. If there are any more kittens later on, I shall probably keep going back along my Perkins line (which is traceable to 1380 in Shropshire and Warwickshire) for names—]ohn being the next in order. But I seldom call a cat by any one name. When I speak to little Sam I call him all sorts of things—"Little Black Dent", "Old Nigger Man", "Spawn of the Shadows", "Little Piece of the Night", "Old Black Panther", "Little Onyx Sphinx", "Child of Bast", and so on, and so on ..... not excluding the succinct and universal "Kittie"! ....

Yrs. most sincerely,
HPL
