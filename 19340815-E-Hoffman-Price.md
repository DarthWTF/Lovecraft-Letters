Hail, Malik:—

...

Regarding my own stuff—it is a regrettable fact that I am never likely to produce anything of general acceptability. While having the highest respect for the authors of realistic fiction, and envying those who are able to accomplish the successful reflection of life in a narrative form, I am sadly aware through actual experiment that this is a province definitely closed to me. The fact is, that I have absolutely nothing to say where actual, unvarnished life is concerned. The events of life are so profoundly and chronically uninteresting to me—and I know so little about them as a whole—that I can't scrape up anything in connexion with them which could possibly have the zest and tension and suspense needed to form a real story. That is, I am incurably blind to dramatic or fictional values except where violations of the natural order are concerned. Of course, I understand *objectively* what these values are, and can apply them with fair success to the criticism and revision of others' work; but they do not take hold of my imagination sufficiently to find creative expression. When I try to think up some vivid sequence of actual events I simply come to nothing. The spark of creation and instinctive dramatic arrangement simply isn't there. I'm not deeply interested, and I can't get deeply interested. What is more—I don't know enough about life to be an effective exponent of it. On account of my early ill-health and naturally retiring disposition my contacts with mankind—and with its varied aspects, folkways, idioms, attitudes, and standards—have been extremely limited; so that there are probably very few people outside the extreme rustic class who are more fundamentally unsophisticated than myself. I don't know what different kinds of people do and think and feel and say—their lives, languages, values, and technical processes are as remote from me as the manners and customs of the Cingalese.

Now it is impossible to write about one's spatial neighbors as one would write about the Cingalese—as remotely and objectively, that is—so that the would-be realist who does not know life well is perforce compelled to resort to imitation—copying what he picks up from the doubtful and artificial media of books, plays, newspaper reports, and the like. That is what Long does—but I am too actual a realist in psychology to be able to do this. I know so damned well that the picture one gets from books is unreal and distorted. That I *can't* sit down and transcribe those second-hand (and probably erroneous) impressions with all the assumed convincingness of one who really knows about them. I know that I *don't* know about the people I'd be writing about, hence I can't put up a jaunty bluff that their ways and speech and thoughts are familiar to me. Let us say that I'm called upon to portray the way one of your dashing young clubman-detectives responds to a given situation. Now I'm not a dashing young clubman-detective and never was one—nor have I ever been acquainted with any. Obviously I don't know how the hell one of them (assuming that there are such persons) would react to any given situation. How, then, can I portray any of their deeds? If I copy from other writers I'll probably be copying artificial gestures remote from reality—and knowing this, I can't put any zest into copying. And this is true of so many different types of person—there are so *few* types that I really understand (and I'm not sure that I understand even them)—that I could never piece out the dramatis personae of any well-rounded work of fiction. My handicap is—all apart from the basic lack of interest—really twofold. First, my acquaintance with varied phases of life is too small for effective literary use. Second, I lack the natural faculty of imagination which gives the genuine innate author the instinctive power to understand and portray what different sorts of people would feel and think and say and do in various situations. Long also lacks this faculty, but he won't admit it. All his characters are little duplicate Belknaps in thought, manner, and speech. But I *realise* my lack and can't go ahead weaving vacuity when I *know* it's vacuity.

However—the crucial thing is my lack of interest in ordinary life. No one ever wrote a story yet without some real emotional drive behind it—and I have not that drive except where violations of the natural order .... defiances and evasions of time, space, and cosmic law .... are concerned. Just why this is so I haven't the slightest idea—it simply *is* so. I am interested only in broad pageants—historic streams—orders of biological, chemical, physical, and astronomical organisation—and the only conflict which has any deep emotional significance to me is that of *the principle of freedom or irregularity or adventurous opportunity against the eternal and maddening rigidity of cosmic law* .... especially the laws of *time*. Individuals and their fortunes within natural law move me very little. They are all momentary trifles bound from a common nothingness towards another common nothingness. Only the cosmic framework itself—or such individuals as symbolise principles (or defiances of principles) of the cosmic framework—can gain a deep grip on my imagination and set it to work creating. In other words, the only "heroes" I can write about are *phenomena*. The cosmos is such a closely-locked round of fatality—with everything prearranged—that nothing impresses me as *really dramatic* except some sudden and abnormal *violation of that relentless inevitability* .... something which cannot exist, but which can be imagined as existing. Hence the type of thing I try to write. Naturally, I am aware that this forms a very limited special field so far as mankind en masse is concerned; but I believe (as pointed out in that *Recluse* article) that the field is an authentic one despite its subordinate nature. This protest against natural law, and tendency to weave visions of escape from orderly nature, are characteristic and eternal factors in human psychology, even though very small ones. They exist as permanent realities, and have always expressed themselves in a typical form of art from the earliest fireside folk tales and ballads to the latest achievements of Blackwood or Machen or de la Mare or Dunsany. The art exists—whether the majority like it or not. It is small and limited, but real—and there is no reason why its practitioners should be ashamed of it. Naturally, one would *rather* be a broad artist with power to evoke beauty from every phase of experience—but when one unmistakably *isn't* such an artist, there's no sense in bluffing and faking and pretending that one *is*. .... Art is not what one resolves to say, but what insists on saying itself through one. It has nothing to do with commerce, editorial demand, or popular approval. The only elements concerned are the artist and the emotions working within him. Of course, there is a business magazine-purveying which is perfectly honest in itself, and a worthy field for those with a knack for it. I wish I had the knack. But this isn't the thing I'm interested in. If I had the knack, it would be something performed entirely apart from my serious work—just as my present revisory activities are. However, I haven't the knack, and the field is so repugnant to me that it's about the last way I'd ever choose to gain shelter and clothing and nourishment. Any other kind of a legitimate job would be preferable to my especial tastes. I dislike this trade because it bears a mocking external resemblance to the real literary composition which is the only thing (apart from sundry ancestral traditions) I take seriously in life.

Although greatly encouraged by the comments on *The Thing on the Doorstep*, I do not think I had better attempt any more writing till my nerves are in better shape. I must finish an especially disagreeable revision job on which I am engaged, and must do more toward getting both the pulp models and my own previous attempts out of my head. Also, I must read more. Then, after a suitable fallow period, I *may* (though one can't tell) have another such creative burst as I had in 1920. If not—that's simply that. It can't be helped. I may be as thoroughly played out as Blackwood now appears to be. I don't know—and there's nothing to do but experiment .... and keep as clear as possible of external criticisms and rebuffs. That's why I don't submit the *Doorstep* to Wright. For the present, then, I am a reader and appreciator rather than a writer. God knows I want a job—but I want it to be *anything*—elevator man, pickaxe artist, night-watchman, stevedore, what the hell—*except writing*. Anything except a parody on the only thing in life that means anything to me.
