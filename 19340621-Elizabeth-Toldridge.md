St. Augustine, Fla.,  
June 21, 1934.

Dear Miss Toldridge:—

.................. The cats at De Land were all prospering when last I saw them; though one—Jack—has been through a trying experience. he was missing for a day, & when he turned up again he seemed curiously ill. All sense of balance was gone, & he lurched & staggered like a feline tuper! As he grew stronger, he seemed anxious to visit a neighbouring clump of palmettoes near the lake—where it was discovered, lay a small snake ... dead, & with a somewhat tooth-mangled cranium. Undoubtedly Jack had chosen this reptile for his prey, & had become poisoned by his ophidian feast. He's coming out all right, though. Of the little possums, only one managed to survive for any length of time, & even succumbed in the end. He received the name of Henry, & graduated long before his demise from medicine-dropper nutritive methods. At another place in De Land I saw the most exquisite black kitten—a tiny atom, but wildly playful—that can be imagined.

................... Early in June I visited a most impressive spot—Silver Springs, some 60 miles from De Land. here is found a series of placid lagoons whose floor is riddled with vast pits 30 to 60 feet deep, & covered with curious marine vegetation. In many places divers have encountered the huge bones of prehistoric animals, & one pit contains the remains of a weed-grown ship's boat— associated by local legend with the early Spanish explorers. I saw these varied wonders from a glass-bottomed boat. out of the lagoons flows the Silver River, as typical a tropic Stream as the Congo or Amazon, with tall palms, trailing vines & moss, & bending cypresses along the swampy banks. Alligators, turtles, & snakes abound, & on either side the jungle stretches away uninterruptedly for miles. It is here that the cinema of *Tarzan* was photographed. I took a 10 mile launch trip on the river, & could easily have imagines myself in the heart of Africa. Am now in ancient St. Augustine—at the same quiet hotel I patronised in 1931. Staying a week—an utterly fascinating town!

Best wishes—
