The Antient Hill  
—Oct. 18, 1936

Tovaritch Kheh-es:—

..... About sleep—7 rather than 8 hours per noctem is my average. Different individuals, I believe, require different amounts—as may even the same individual at different ages. I don't often stage 60-hour wakeful sessions as I did (through necessity) last month, & in recent years I have resorted less & less to my old time-saving device of cutting out a single night's rest occasionally. ..

... I agree that most of the motive force behind any contemplated change in the economic order will necessarily come from the persons
who have benefited least by the existing order; but I do not see why
that fact makes it necessary to wage the struggle otherwise than as *a fight to guarantee a place for everybody* in the social fabric. The just demand of the citizen is that society assign him a place in its complex mechanism whereby he will have equal chances for education at the start, & a guarantee of just rewards for such services as he is able to render (or a proper pension if his services cannot be used) later on. Now this does not apply merely to the stevedore & elevator-boy. It applies equally to the artist & professor & administrator. The same social principle which assumes that positions should be artificially allocated to men of the factory-hand level of accomplishment, assumes also that positions should be artificially allocated to men of the trained executive level; each individual to be given a return determined by the kind & quality of the service he renders. The man of executive calibre benefits as much as the man of the factory-hand calibre in point of security, so we cannot truly call the principle a "class" issue. If anybody might call it a "class issue" it is the man of executive calibre, who feels that he loses more than he gains—since under the old order he was fairly sure of a job anyhow, & generally received a larger return (in unearned profits) than the just one which the new order would allot him. .. But the real aim of the socialist is essentially a classless one. He is not thinking of benefiting this special group or harming that special group. He's simply thinking of ensuring just placement to *everybody*—& if his conception of just placement doesn't measure up to the wishes of any certain group, then the "class issue" is the "injured" group's—*not the socialist's*. This, I believe, is a far sounder conception than the "class conscious" one. The war is not of any one "class" against any other "class". It is of *the people*—each human being considered as an equal unit irrespective of the amount of so-called "property" attached to him—against anybody & everybody who would obstruct a programme guaranteeing each member of the people security & opportunities commensurate with his skill. This may, of course, mean—in terms of contemporary society—a struggle in which the low-paid wage-worker & the unemployed predominate on one side whilst the highly-paid businessman & inheritor of wealth predominate on the other side; but I think it is more socially wholesome—more favourable to a rational mood & perspective, & better adapted to the psychology of the future order aimed at—to think of the matter in general human terms than to think of it in terms of the *present* industrial status of the majority of participants on either side.

.. It is better to fight *for a just deal for all people* in the name of *all the people* (& who cares if some of the people refuse to be represented?) than in the name of any special "working class". In a decent society everyone is "worker"—but if we use the term too narrowly today, we shall find that it creates mental overtones & images not at all favourable to the best type of development. There will be a tendency to exalt & idealise the contemporary low-grade worker *just as he is*, instead of to insist that his attributes be radically changed through the extension to him of a security & body of cultural privileges he has never possessed before. There will be a tendency to hate & injure the refinements & amenities of high-grade life, & to subordinate the cultural traditions which mean so much to sensitive persons, simply because these things have not hitherto been enjoyed by those classifiable as "workers". Excellence in human personality will be opposed, slighted, or jeered at as something hatefully "aristocratic" or "bourgeois"; whilst many of the crude & repellent folkways & attitudes of the present "working class" (folkways & attitudes which would not exist if justice prevailed) will be exalted as great national values. Now all this is very bad, & makes for increased bitterness. There ought not to be any rallying around the standards & ideals of the contemporary workman, together with a massed hatred of the standards & ideals of the contemporary aristocrat. Standards & ideals should not be associated with one "class" any more than with any other "class". Keeping well-groomed & talking grammatically & enjoying Horace & possessing sensitive honour—in brief, being a gentleman—ought not to be associated with the inheritor of a fortune any more than with an intelligent mechanic or miner. *We must learn to divorce the idea of human status & attributes from the relatively trivial concepts of remunerative occupation & financial position*. There will always be *narutal* aristocrats & men of taste, & there will always be crude clods; but in a rational society it may be that the aristocrats will include people whose *purely economic* activities are relatively insignificant—miners, mill-hands, 'bus-drivers, &c—whilst the crude clods will include highly-paid industrial administrators. The big idea is to *substitute the idea of personal excellence for that of economic position*—& in order to do that, we must not encourage any hatred or repudiation of those high qualities which are at present (through long injustice) associated with the "ruling class". heaven knows, there is too much "class consciousness" in our *present* order! Listen to any average discussion of a stranger, & see how infallibly his economic status is brought up & dwelt upon! Read any news item about an accident, an arrest, a marriage, or a death, & see how infallibly a mention of *economic occupation* is tagged on to each person named .. John Smoth, grocer, age 50 ... William Jones, insurance agent .... George Brown, labourer ... &c. &c. &c. .... as if the principal thing about John Smith were the fact that he is a grocer ... as if he had no rounded individuality or complex personality of his own; no likes & dislikes; no taste in art or literature; no philosophic position or social belief ..... They never say "John Smith, admirer of Greek Sculpture" or "John Smith, phenomenalist", or "John Smith, student of astronomy" .... it is instead, always "John Smith, grocer"! This, mind you, is the vice of the *old* order—thousands of years old. I don't accuse the Marxians of inventing it. I merely think the rationa socialist ought to *repudiate* it instead of *clinging to it & intensifying it!*

..... If the Marxians would lay less stress on the literal hammer & sickle & lay more stress on *general circumstance of prevailing inequality & injustice*, they would win over more of the ill-paid professors & bankrupt small grocers & corporation-fleeced inventors & booted-around bookkeepers of whose continued capitalistic sympathies they so justly complain. *The big mistake of the Marxians is that they blind themselves to all non-economic factors*. They expect a man to act primarily according to his *economic* status, where in reality his primary reaction is determined wholly by his *culture* status. We act first & instinctively with the *sort of people whose tastes & background are like our own*. Only with difficulty & in mature years are we generally able to think & act independently of our hereditary culture-milieu—& all too few of us can ever achieve that independence. Most of the dispossessed non-workmen are products of the general culture-milieu which also produced the "ruling class", hence they can never be expected to act as enemies of that "class" *as class*—especially if those who invite them to do so are conspicuously & avowedly the representatives of another & frankly inferior culture-milieu. If socialism wishes to create a really effective "popular front" against the system of special privilege, it must cease to represent any particular proletarian type. It must stand forth simply as the dispenser of real justice & best hope of the *economically* disadvantaged, & must abandon all traces of hostility towards the *culture* of the lucky propertied elements on whom, in practice, it will be waging war. This for two reasons: because that culture is one also shared by many of those it wishes to win over, & because that culture must eventually, in all essentials, form the general culture of all the people. Probably socialism *will* more or less broaden in the right direction. Even now the conscious "have-nots" are acquiring an increasingly impressive stream of recruits from the tanks of the traditionally cultured; & although many of these recruits profess to be converted to the one-sided ideology of proletarianism, the net influence of the influx is all in favour of reconciling the socialist movement with the hereditary culture of the race. More & more a socialist may be well-born person who thinks & feels as a gentleman, & whose warfare is that of a just & responsible gentleman upon a *system* (not a group of men) which viciously denies part of the community the basic rights which taste & logic demand for all. Look at such popular leaders as FDR, Bertrand Russell, Karl Marx himself, Oliver Baldwin, Norman Thomas, Leon Blum, Rexford G. Tugwell, & scores of others—all products of the general culture of the "ruling class", & none in all probability desirous of enthroning any new culture opposed to its noneconomic phases. (Briffault & some of the extreme left theorists are another story). Persons of this general type are more numerous in the ranks of the socialists each year, & the result will probably be a good one. If there ever has to be something corresponding to a "class war", it will probably be waged on purely economic lines, & not fall into the incidental tragic pattern of a war of plebeian coarseness & ignorance against patrician taste, intellect, & refinement.
