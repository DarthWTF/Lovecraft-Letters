Dear Jehvish-Ei:—

..................... What you say of my epistles—& of the potential essays or articles imbedded in some of them—pleases & flatters me extremely. I dare say that many of my expository or controversial harangues (as well as those of the correspondents at the other end) are equivalent to essays in length & subject-matter—although they have the fatal defects of hasty thought & careless composition. They are, after all, only the random thoughts of a rank layman—not the well-considered utterances of a qualified student of the subjects involved. I used to write articles of all sorts, but in my latter years I have developed a marked distaste for inadequate & ill-informed pamphleteering. Cracker-barrel debating is all well enough for private correspondence—where all hands are laymen—but it makes me rather tired to see a half-baked ordinary guy shooting off his mouth in public on subjects which none but the special student can rightly handle. However—once in a very long while I copy certain definite arguments or expositions from letters I have just written; circulating the copy among other correspondents interested in the same thing or (though less often than 10 or 20 years ago) having it printed in one of the small papers of the "amateur journalistic" circle. In such a case I de-personalise the text to some extent—separating it from the occasion & context of the original letter & supplying a proper opening & conclusion of the standard essay type. As a typical illustration of this I think I'll enclose an "article" on the American political situation which I copied last November from a letter to a more or less plutocratic correspondent in Chicago—a rather important official in The (ex-Insull) Commonwealth Edison Co. there. This chap—Ernest A. Edkins—is a splendidly witty & civilised character, with fine aesthetic appreciations; but he cannot quite escape the visionless & conventional psychology of the "businessman"—hence is a bitter & apprehensive opponent of the present administration, He & I had been desultorily arguing for some time, but at last I decided to undermine his position in the most thorough way; hence wrote him an enormous letter in an effort to get down to the very roots of the matter. When I had finished, it occurred to me that I'd like to present the same text to many other friends & correspondents—not only reactionaries like Edkins, but wild-eyed bolsheviki like Long, who lean just as absurdly in the opposite direction. Hence I typed an impersonalised version of the crucial argument in my usual way, & have been letting it go the rounds ever since. Just now it is here again, & I believe I'll enclose it to you as a sample of my latter-day "essay-writing". You may or may not agree with the politics—I am for a fascism which includes as much socialisation as may be found necessary for a proper spreading of resources—but at any rate you have a sample of the way an "article" can be made from a letter. (Please return this item.)

.......................... As for the matter of childhood recollections—of course, such can be made very interesting if one knows how; though there is always a feeling of deficient significance unless the childhood in question be the preface to a fruitful & important adulthood. When the high-flown imaginings of the child peter out in a manhood of mediocrity & non-achievement like mine, there is an ever-present sense of mocking anticlimax which makes formal exploitation subtly ridiculous & out of place. It is all very well for a dull old man to recall his boyhood privately & informally—in correspondence or conversations with friends—but to publish the same material as a conscious literary attempt is quite another matter. Of course, some literary merit might possibly be present—but the sense of anticlimax would always be a vitiating element. Regarding the extent to which recent writers have exploited or neglected the matter of correlation with the time-stream—I was not thinking of Proust, since I tend to group him within the main tradition rather than among the moderns. Probably no writer has more magnificently captured the sense of time than Proust—-there are parts of *Swann’s Way* which shew a marvellous identification of the adult with the child. Certainly, I must try to continue my Proustian reading before long ..... what is the third book of the series—*Cities of the Plain*? I can comprehend Proust's sensations at finding his friends aged after a long absence from them. Only last week my best friend of the early 1900's—Chester Pierce Munroe—turned up in Providence after long years of residence in the south. I had not set eyes on him since 1916 or so, & had seen very little of him since 1912 or 1913. Good god! Was this iron-grey-headed, slightly paunchy middle-aged man (he's one year my senior) the little Chet Munroe of 1902 & 1903? I knew, of course, that I had changed just as much (though I did avoid the paunch through my 1925 reducing!)—yet the sudden confrontation with this image, so different from the established Chester-Munroe-image of my subconscious mind, was none the less a shock. Only the voice was familiar. That, indeed, was just the same as when it emerged from the changing process around 1905 or ‘06. The fact is, it has probably aged far Jess than the average voice—for how many men of 44 talk *exactly* as they did in their middle 'teens? Chester's memories of boyhood are very keen, & he could name a very Jarge number of the children in our Slater Ave. class photograph of 1903—including those (a numerical majority) whom he had never seen since then. It is probably true that the period from 7 to 14 produces more lasting impressions than any other, We can, in later life, generally return to childhood more readily than to young manhood. This is one reason why the memories of the very aged usually centre largely around the 10-year-old period—another reason being that the mental structure has in that age generally suffered a letdown to about the to-year-old level of intellection & emotional sympathy, so that a man of 90 can often understand himself better at 10 than at 20 or 30 or 40. Differences in individual rates of aging—& differences in separate *phases* of aging (hair, face, voice, figure, gestures, intellect, emotions, &c.)—are often very marked, & furnish a highly interesting study. I know men of my own age who could easily pass for sons of mine—& others who look as though they might be my father. It is all a matter of glands—of which time is only a rough measure. ...

I was greatly interested in your childhood memories, & hope you will some time work them into a novel of retrospective cast. It is curious how juvenile reading has changed—& ironic to reflect that of the books of my period only the very poorest (the Rover Boys' Series) have survived. I suppose this series has been endlessly continued & brought down to date—so that the grandsons of the original Rover Boys are
now parallelling their adventures on aëroplanes & submarines & rocket space-ships! Of the newer books you mention I have heard only of the Tom Swift series—rather poor junk according to a friend of mine who deplores his young hopeful’s addiction to it. Your early glasses remind me of myself—I wore them at 7, though at many later periods I tried leaving them off, so that today I wear them only for middle-distance
vision (theatre, cinema, illustrated lectures, &c.) The ghost stories you heard from other children form an interesting item. I never heard oral weird tales except from my grandfather—who, observing my tastes in reading, used to devise all sorts of impromptu original yarns about black woods, unfathomed caves, winged horrors (like the "night-gaunts" of my dreams, about which I used to tell him), old witches with sinister cauldrons, & "deep, low, moaning sounds". He obviously drew most of his imagery from the early gothic romances—Radcliffe, Lewis, Maturin, &c.—which he seemed to like better than Poe or other later fantaisistes. He was the only other person I knew—young or old—who cared for macabre & horrific fiction.

My first memories are of the summer of 1892—just before my second birthday. We were then vacationing in Dudley, Mass., & I recall the house with its frightful attic water-tank & my rocking-horses at the head of the stairs. I recall also the plank walks laid to facilitate walking in rainy weather—& a wooded ravine, & a boy with a small rifle who let me pull the trigger while my mother held me. At that period my
father was alive & in business in Boston, so that our residences were around the Boston suburbs—Dorchester & Auburndale. In the latter place we stayed with my mother's friend, the rather famous poetess Louise Imogen Guiney, pending the construction of a house of our own. That house was never built—for my father was fatally stricken in April 1893, & my mother & I moved back to the old maternal Providence home where I was born. My first clear & connected memories centre in Auburndale—the shady streets, the bridge over the 4-tracked B. & A. R. R. with the business section beyond, the Guiney home in Vista Ave., the poetess's great St. Bernard dogs, the verse-reciting sessions at which I was made to stand on a table & spout Mother Goose & other infantile classics, the sunsets beyond the trees—& so on, I remembered the place so well that I walked straight to the house from the station when I revisited it in 1908. I can just remember my father—an immaculate figure in black coat & vest & grey striped trousers. I had a childish habit of slapping him on the knees & shouting "Papa, you look just like a young man!" I don't know where I picked that phrase up; but I was vain & self-conscious, & given to repeating things which I saw tickled my elders. I was highly nervous—as restless & fidgety as you were—& distinctly like to "show off". This latter tendency—& the vanity & self-consciousness behind it—later succumbed to good advice & the better perspective of life imparted by reading, though its disappearance was slow & gradual. I first saw a play at the age of 6. Later, when the cinema appeared as a separate institution (it had been part of Keith vaudeville since 1898 or 1899), I attended it often with other fellows, but never took it seriously. By the time of the first cinema shows (March, 1906, in Providence) I knew too much of literature & drama not to recognise the utter & unrelieved hokum of the moving picture. Still, I attended them—in the same spirit that I had read Nick Carter, Old King Brady, & Frank Reade in nickel-novel form. Escape—relaxation. It was not till later that I got fed up & no longer enjoyed such mentally juvenile performances. The earliest "stars" I remember (their names weren't given till about '07 or ’08) are Maurice Costello, Henry Walthall, Florence Turner, Hobart Bosworth, &c. ..... I recall many faces, too, without the corresponding names. I think the subsequently famous Mary Pickford didn't appear till '08 or '09. Of stage stars I saw most of the celebrated figures of the late '90's & early 1900's, though I most unfortunately missed Sir Henry Irving. In the matter of the justly celebrated "facts of life" I didn’t wait for oral information, but exhausted the entire subject in the medical section of the family library (to which I had access, although I wasn’t especially loquacious about this side of my reading) when I was 8 years old—through Quain's Anatomy (fully illustrated & diagrammed), Dunglinson's Physiology, &c. &c. This was because of curiosity & perplexity concerning the strange reticences & embarrassments of adult speech, & the oddly inexplicable allusions & situations in standard literature. The result was the very opposite of what parents generally fear—for instead of giving me an abnormal & precocious interest in sex (as *unsatisfied* curiosity might have done), it virtually killed my interest in the subject. The whole matter was reduced to prosaic mechanism—a mechanism which I rather despised or at least thought non-glamourous because of its purely animal nature & separation from such things as intellect & beauty—& all the drama was taken out of it. When the kids talked or acted dirtily I could have told them more than they tried to tell me—although (such was the state of Victorian formal medicine) my knowledge was restricted wholly to normal sex. I was middle-aged & married before I ever knew that there was such a thing as instinctive homosexuality—though I suppose there must be dozens of Haldeman-Julius booklets about the matter now. I talked as toughly as anybody else, since I didn’t wish to be a sissy; but my real ideals of life always inclined toward the ascetic. I didn't slop over in youthful romance, since I didn't believe—& still don't—in the existence of sentimental "love" as a definite, powerful, or persistent human emotion. I have always regarded marriage as composed of friendly regard, mental congeniality, social foresight, & practical advantage; to which *at first* the element of biological eroticism is added. Later the element of familiar affection & family loyalty develops—if the experiment happens to "take", as a few seem to do. But my idea of life has always been to depend on the animal & emotional sides—essentially capricious, mutable, & soon exhausted—as little as possible; choosing rather that abstract & contemplative side which involves the independent & permanent elements of reason & imagination, With me, the hardest emotion to bring under the control of reason was hatred—as expressed in berserk rages & general pugnacity. I had some fairly rough fights (from which I would not retreat, but in which I almost always got the worst except when I managed to frighten my foe through a dramatically murderous expression & voice) till I was 16 or 17—but as I grew up my recognition of the deterministic automatism of the whole cosmos, & the ridiculous insignificance & futility of all human actions, gave me an entirely new perspective. I could no longer see anything *personal* or *responsible* in anything that anybody did, & began to look on all mankind as impersonally as one looks on a cage full of monkeys in a zoo. This had the effect of almost deleting the emotion of anger from my personality, & of giving me a philosophic calm I had never possessed before. Today I am extremely tranquil—although of course, as a matter of aesthetics, I take no actual encroachments from anybody. It is now much easier for me to despise or laugh at a person or thing than to hate him or it. When I fight (& it's years since I've had any physical set-to) it is not from berserk rage, but simply from an English gentleman's instinctive need of personal inviolateness, non-encroachment, & satisfied honour. I pick quarrels with no one—but the Nordic's only possible reply to a real affront is to tell the affronter to go to hell, My first acute realisation
of time was when I saw newspapers bearing the heavily-inked date-line TUESDAY, JANUARY 1, 1895. 1895*!!* To me the symbol 1894 had represented an eternity—the eternity of the *present* as distinguished from such things as 1066 or 1492 or 1642 or 1776—& the idea of personally outliving that eternity was absorbingly impressive to me, even though I had fully realised, in an abstract way, that I would do so ..... that I had been born in 1890 & would probably (in view of the average death-ages of near kinsfolk) live till about 1960. I shall never forget the sensation I derived from the idea of *moving through time* (if forward, why not backward?) which that '95 date-line gave me. But possibly I mentioned this in my previous letter. The one time that I seriously thought of suicide was in & after 1904, when my grandfather died in the midst of business tangles (he was president of a land & irrigation corporation exploiting the Snake River in Idaho, & the total destruction of the dam on which everything depended had caused a frightful situation) & left us all relatively poor. I was (being predominantly geographical-minded) tremendously attached to the old home at 454 Angell St. (now housing 12 physicians' offices—I walk by it still as often as I can) with its grounds & fountain, & stable, but this now had to go .... indeed, there had been drastic economies for 5 years before that. My mother & I moved into a 5-room-&-attic flat two squares farther cast (598 Angell St., where I dwelt till 1924) & for the first time I knew what a congested, servantless home—with another family in the same house—was. There was a vacant lot next door (although even that was later built up—during my adulthood), which I promptly exploited as a landscape garden & adorned with a village of piano-box houses, but even that failed to assuage my nostalgia. I felt that I had lost my entire adjustment to the cosmos—for what indeed was HPL without the remembered rooms & hallways & hangings & staircases & statuary & paintings (now—after 30 years of storage—my aunt & I *again* have one of the statues & several of the large paint-

ings, since by a miracle the rooms & hallway of 66 College can accommodate them) & yard & walks & cherry-trees & fountain & ivy-grown arch & stable & gardens & all the rest? How could an old man of 14 (& I surely felt that way!) readjust his existence to a skimpy flat & new household programme & inferior outdoor setting in which almost nothing familiar remained? It seemed like a damned futile business to keep on living. No more tutors—high school next September which would probably be a devilish bore, since one couldn't be as free & easy in high school as one had been during brief snatches at the neighbourly Slater Ave. school. ...... Oh, hell! Why not slough off consciousness altogether? The whole life of man & of the planet was a mere cosmic second—so I couldn't be missing much. The *method* was the only trouble. I didn't like messy exits, & dignified ones were hard to find. Really good poisons were hard to get—those in my chemical laboratory (I reëstablished this institution in the basement of the new place) were crude & painful. Bullets were spattery & unreliable. Hanging was ignominious. Daggers were messy unless one could arrange to open a wrist-vein in a bowl of warm water—& even that had its drawbacks despite good Roman precedent. Falls from a cliff were positively vulgar in view of the probable state of the remains. Well—what tempted me most was the warm, shallow, reed-grown Barrington River down the east shore of the bay. I used to go there on my bicycle & look speculatively at it. (That summer I was always on my bicycle—wishing to be away from home as much as possible, since my abode reminded me of the home I had lost.) How easy it would be to wade out among the rushes & lie face down in the warm water till oblivion came. There would be a certain gurgling or choking unpleasantness at first—but it would soon be over. Then the long peaceful night of non-existence .... what I had enjoyed from the mythical start of eternity till the 20th of August, 1890. More & more I looked at the river on drowsy, sun-golden summer afternoons, I liked to think of the beauty of sun & blue river & green shore & distant white steeple as enfolding me at the last—it would be as if the element of mystical cosmic beauty were dissolving me. And yet certain elements—notably scientific curiosity & a
sense of world drama—held me back. Much in the universe baffled me, yet I knew I could pry the answers out of books if I lived & studied longer. Geology, for example. Just how did these ancient sediments & stratifications get crystallised & upheaved into granite peaks? Geography—just *what* would Scott & Shackleton & Borchgrevink find in the great white antarctic on their next expeditions .... which I could—if I wished—live to see described? And as to history—as I contemplated an exit without further knowledge I became uncomfortably conscious of what I didn’t know. Tantalising gaps existed everywhere. When did people stop speaking Latin & begin to talk Italian & Spanish & French? What on earth ever happened in the black Middle Ages in those parts of the world other than Britain & France (whose story I knew) ? What of the vast gulfs of space outside all familiar lands—desert reaches hinted of by Sir John Mandeville & Marco Polo .... Tartary, Thibet. .... What of unknown Africa? I knew that many things which were mysteries to me were not such to others. I had not resented my lack of a solution as long as I expected to know *some day*—but now that the idea of *never knowing* presented itself, the circumstance of frustrated curiosity became galling to me. Mathematics, too, Could a gentleman properly die without having demonstrated on paper why the square of the hypothenuse of a right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides? So in the end I decided to postpone my exit till the following summer. I would do a little curiosity-satisfying at first; filling certain gaps of scientific & historical knowledge, & attaining a greater sense of *completeness* before merging with the infinite blackness. Especially would I solve that always-teasing question of how & when "Romans" named *Fabius Anicius* became "Italians" named *Fabio Anizio*. Well—that fall I found high school a delight & stimulus instead of a bore, & the next spring I resumed publication of the *R. I. Journal of Astronomy*, which I had allowed to lapse. Possibly I would wait till '06 before making my exit ..... one could drown in '06 just as well as in '05 or '04! But *new* questions demanding answers were always springing up. First-year *physics* opened problems connected with the nature of visible phenomena & the operation of the universe which my earlier chemistry & astronomy had not even suggested ..... was it possible that educated men knew things about the basic structure of the cosmos which invalidated all my confidently-held concepts? And god! what a surprise *history* was proving! The whole pageantry of the *Byzantine Empire*, & its hostile connexion with that gorgeous Islam which my early Arabian Nights & my later astronomical studies (cf. terms & names like *azimuth*, *zenith*, *Aldebaran*, *almucantar*, *nadir*, *Deneb*, &c.) had made close to me, swept unheralded on my sight—& for the first time I heard of the lost Minoan culture which Sir Arthur Evans was even then busily digging up in Crete. Assyria & Babylonia, too, stood out with greater impressiveness than ever before—& I heard at last of the eternal query of Easter Island. What a world! Why, good god, a man might keep busy forever, even in an uncongenial environment, learning new things . .... pleasantly busy, too, for each new point of satisfied curiosity gave a hell of a kick. Then there was the kick of writing out a mood on paper so that it could be recaptured .... I had done some experimenting in fictional structure, & achieved a new level of results with The Beast in the Cave (ineffably pompous & Johnsonese—I still have it), which I wrote in April '05. Could it be possible that 4 poor man without servants or a large house & grounds might get a greater satisfaction from remaining alive & studying & writing than from slipping back to primal nescience & molecular dispersal? The matter was worth considering—at least, the end could go over till '06 .... or very possibly, '07. About then I had a nervous breakdown (winter '05-'06) & had to stay out of school for months, & my lack of energy stopped my even thinking about anything. Then the Providence Tribune was founded, & I learned that I had a good chance of breaking into print at last ... contributing monthly astronomical articles just like Prof, Upton's in the *Journal & Bulletin*. One couldn't miss a chance like that! Let suicide wait! And the articles landed, & I also landed others with a rural weekly .... (this was the *Ah, Wilderness* year of '06) .... & before long I was too busy studying & writing to make any especial plans, lethal or otherwise, for the future, So I've let matters slide for thirty years .... although I still intend to bump myself off when I get too broke to live on my present reduced scale. But so great is the pleasure of satisfied scientific curiosity & aesthetic experience, that I think a person of tastes like mine is better off (at least slightly) alive than dead as long as he can get his hands on ten bucks week. That sum will decently house a frugal man & his books & more important pictures & furniture & miscellany—if he can virtually eliminate sartorial replacements (of my 5 suits 3 date from 1925, one from 1928, & the palm beach was given to me!) cut down his food bill to about $2.50 per week (I do), & do a good part of his own laundry (as I also do). But when I have to sacrifice books & family possessions I shall complete the postponed process of 1904. No use at all in dragging along under too inappropriate circumstances, Such, then, is the history of my own adventures toward self-destruction! As for you—I guess it's just as well that you didn't walk out on the world during the Peabody period. It isn't well to give too many damns about what people think of one. The regard & opinions of others never meant very much to me .... since (as I said once before) I've always had a subconscious feeling that everything since the 18th century is unreal & illusory—a sore of grotesque nightmare or caricature, People seem to me more or less like ironic shadows or phantoms—as if I could make them (together with all their modern houses & inventions & perspectives) dissolve into thin aether by merely pinching myself awake & shouting at them, "Why, damn ye, you're not even born, & won't be born for a century & a half! God Save the King, & his Colony of Rhode-Island & Providence-Plantations!" Incidentally—the terrific nightmares of my infancy (peopled with black-winged "night-gaunts") probably had something to do with my feeling that I could dismiss all the modern world & its denizens by simply waking myself. In those nightmares I often *knew that I was dreaming*, & strove in every possible way to struggle awake—hence the mental pattern of throwing off a distasteful environment by waking out of it. I still have some tremendously odd dreams—some of which I know to be such. Only last week I had a very curious one about the decay & ruin of the city. I tried to wake, but when I had come out of the dream I felt that I *was not really awake even then*. Something was wrong, even though a
bright morning sun was shining on the bed from an east window. Then I realised. *There ought not to be any east window* ..... I was in my old room at 598 Angell St., which I haven't inhabited for ten years! But how could I wake up? After all, was I asleep? Was it not possible that everything since early in 1924 was a dream? That I had never left 598—never gone to Brooklyn & Barnes St, & College St. .... ? But no! Here was the sun *where it hadn't been since 1912 or 1913* .... for a house had been built against my windows. *I knew that*. I couldn't swear I had ever lived away from 598, but I knew that my eastern sunlight had been cut off by a new house, And yet, there it blazed! Clearly, I was asleep ..... asleep, & on that unstable plane where anything might happen, Into what vortex of nightmare might I not be pitched without warning at any moment? But how could I escape? Pinching seemed to do no good. And even if I did have another
awakening, how could I know that this *second* one would be final? At last, by a strong mental effort, I made the sunlit room dissolve around me, & emerged into a restful twilight. I stretched in relief .... & then saw that I was still at 598. My windows were shadowed this time,
but the conviction that I no longer lived at 598 was stronger. The chances were about 8 to 2, it seemed to me, that I was still asleep. I shook myself, lifted myself on my elbow, & tried in every way to push myself through another layer of dream. No use. At last a current of cold blackness swept down from somewhere, & I was caught up in a vortex which dissolved all the visible world, Everything melted to chaos, & I soared through endless night against my will, Then hazy outlines began to form—the small panes of an old-fashioned window—daylight—*I was at 66 College St.!* But was I awake? Here was the sun shining in from the south, & I was in the house I ought to be in *but I could not be sure yet*. There was an odd aura of doubt which grew & grew—& at last everything dissolved again, No vortex this time, but just a diffusive greyness, And then the outlines of the small-paned window again—this time with only the College St. arc light at the mouth of the court behind it. I shook myself once more, & speculated as to my degree of awakeness. It seemed very doubtful. Still, I might as well test my condition, I rose & turned on the light. 4 a. m. I raised the curtain & looked at the world outside, T went out into the library & to the bathroom, & returned to bed, Still devilish sleepy. Soon I was dreaming of my old home at 454 Angell St. I definitely waked around 8 a. m.—*but do not yet know whether I was really awake & up at 4 o'clock*. ...........................

I perused your cinematic notes with usual interest. During my visit to Long I was dragged to the cinema several times, but the only item worth remembering was a comedy called *Three-Cornered Moon*—a satire on pseudo-aesthetes, At home—& on my own initiative—I saw *Berkeley Square* again ... incidentally beholding as a companion film the not-half-bad *Wild Boys of the Road* which you mention, Also went to see *The Invisible Man*. Surprisingly good—might easily have been absurd, yet succeeded in being genuinely sinister. Since receiving your letter I have witnessed *The World Changes*—a fine piece of pageantry, though incredibly naive as a drama, & not even rudimentarily comparable to *Cavalcade*. I liked the pioneer period & the momentarily glimpsed
horse-car, Also—the 1880-period & 1893 interiors fascinated me, since they were exactly like the houses I knew in my first conscious days. That parlour where the funeral was held might have been taken out of 454 Angell St. The 1904 scenes were good—costumes accurate, but one detail of grooming wrong, Young sports did *not* grow those little bits of side-whisker seen on the sons as early as '04. That was a fad lasting from '06 or '07 to '10 or so. In '04 the clean shave was universal among everybody under 30. I note what you say concerning the gifted stars of *Henry VII & Berkeley Square*. If Leslie Howard was in that *Outward Bound* performance of 1924 I certainly must have seen him there, The years seem to have used him kindly since that period. By the way—when I spoke of his accent I did not mean that I had any trouble in *understanding* him. Indeed, no British accent ever gives me trouble, for I have heard lecturers & others from the Mother Land all my life, I merely note a certain difference from Providence speech in some cases. I noticed it especially in Howard because he was supposed to be an American. In Laughton I certainly did not seem to notice it to any such degree—but perhaps that was merely a result of my inattention. I shall probably see *Little Women* sooner or later—though the book bored me to death 35 years ago, & the period is one I abominate, In all the times I've been to Concord (a marvellous repository of colonial reliques) I've never visited the Alcott house—which is open
as a public museum. Haven't yet seen *The Emperor Jones*—it was here while I was in N.Y. & hasn't returned so far. I shall go when it comes. Sorry you were disappointed. The original play gave me a great kick in 1922 or '23—with a real buck nigger named Charles Gilpin (now dead) in the leading role. Glad you've seen *Berkeley* Square at last. Talman & Long, who saw the play, say that the cinema version is slightly inferior. As you say, there are things about the transferred identities of the two Peters which tend to arouse questions—although the first one that occurred to me was different from yours. My main objection was that *a diary apparently written by a normal 18th century Peter without consciousness of a 20th century personality or awkward position, yet covering the period of the substituted identity,* was left for the modern Peter to inherit & be guided by. How could that be? If during those days in 1784 the visitor at the Pettigrew home was a 20th century invader who knew everything that was going to happen, *then why did he write in his diary as if he were a normal inhabitant of 1784?* Your point, of course, is—*what was the real 18th century Peter doing while the 2oth century Peter usurped his body?* I answered that question in a sketchy sort of way by assuming that he occupied the modern Peter's body in a kind of half-stupor—drinking to drown his perplexity & being regarded by the modern housekeeper (who must have fed him) as her master in a neurotic & alcoholic state, Yet this is clearly a lame explanation. In the case of an actual exchange, the man transported into the unknown future would have had a totally different reaction—& the housekeeper would have noted 2 multitude of queer things. I did not gather that the subsequent remarks of the housekeeper to the modern fiancée referred to the period when the 18th century Peter was in the modern body. One of the things reported was a wild speech in which the speaker told some people (as *I* often feel!) that they wouldn't be born for over a century. Now how could the 18th century Peter, in the confusion of his plight, have known just what had happened? Or—assuming he had kept his head & studied calendars & newspapers in the house—would he have taken the matter in just this way? Also—the master is spoken of as having tried to force his way into White's as a member. Presumably in modern dress—yet how could the 18th century Peter (catapulted into a dressing-gowned body in the 20th century) have dressed himself in the correct modern fashion unassisted? No—in my opinion all this talk of the housekeeper referred to *the 20th century Peter after his return with shattered nerves & a mind filled with 18th century images & doubts of his fixed place in the time-stream*. Think this aver & see if you don't agree with me. But your point is extremely just—what, indeed, was the 18th century Peter doing during the substitution period? This is no more cleared up than the matter of the diary—a plain oversight on the author's part, Also—when the real 18th century Peter got back to 1784 his diary ought to shew some trace of whatever unprecedented experience he had been through. But with all its defects this thing gave me an uncanny wallop. When I revisited it I saw it through twice—& I shall probably go again on its next return, It is the most weirdly perfect embodiment of my own moods & pseudo-memories that I have ever seen—for all my life I have felt as if 1 might wake up out of this dream of an idiotic Victorian age & an insane jazz. age into the same reality of 1760 or 1770 or 1780 .... the age of the white steeples & fanlighted doorways of the ancient hill, & of the long-s'd books of the old dark attic trunk-room at 454 Angell St. God Save the King! ....................

What you say of *Bedelia* explains the mystery of its date & fully vindicates the reminiscent accuracy of O'Neill. For what you cite is not the original song itself, but merely an osbscene or suggestive *parody* of it—the sort of thing which might easily linger on as a vulgar comic feature for years after the real song had become a joke. Such obscene parodies were very common in the old days (are they now?)—almost every supreme hit having one. I never heard of this specimen before, but recall smutty versions of *In the Shade of the Old Apple Tree* (1905), *On a Sunday Afternoon* (1902), & others. Here is the real text of *Bedelia* as published in 1903 & popularised by the comedienne Blanche Ring:

*There's a charming Irish lady with a roguish winning way.  
Who has kept my heart a-thumping & a-bumping night & day;  
She's the flower of killarney, with a Tipperary smile—  
She's the best that ever came from Erin's Isle  
And I find myself a-singing all the while:*  
(Chorus)  
*Bedelia, I'd like to steal you,  
Bedelia, I love you so.  
I'll be your Chauncey Olcott,  
If you'll be my Molly O;  
Say something sweet, Bedelia;  
Your voice I like to hear  
Oh, Bedelia—elia—elia, I've made up my mind to steal you,  
Steal you, steal you,  
Bedelia dear!*

In this wholly innocuous original form *Bedela* was a veritable knock-out—a stampede—lasting well into 1904. I remember my little cousin Phillips Gamwell (now dead—his mother is the aunt now heading my household) singing it at the age of six. But by the fall of '04 it was played out as a serious offering. After that—like *On the Banks of the Wahash*—it became a typical back number, for humerous or parodic use. *You're the Flower of My Heart, Sweet Adeline* (Spring '04) was its principal immediate successor in popular favour—& then in '05 the new riot—*In the shade of the Old Apple Tree* appeared. But of course
