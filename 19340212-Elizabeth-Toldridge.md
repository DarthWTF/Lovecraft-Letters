My dear Toldridge:-

Yes-my trip certainly did contain an unusual number of points of varied interest. No-the art of the younger Wandrei cannot be said to be basically modern. He is at bottom a traditionalist of the main line; & his fantastic conceptions suggest Beardsley, Dor√©, John Martin, Rops, Goya, Fuseli, & other elder masters at the same time that they also embody a strongly original vision & execution. He never employs the modern geometrical conceptions of form, or the attempt to visualise abstractions. What he draws are delirious horrors that one might see if they existed. There is a certain amount of conventionalism & decorativeness, of course, but in general the semblance of natural proportions remains. The power & technique of the drawings are marvellous-& there can be no question of their creator's brilliant future.

I enjoyed that Poe ceremony very much, & especially appreciated Phelps' reference to *Anthony Adverse* because somebody has just lent me that prodigious time! I own Hervey Allen's life of Poe, which is the best yet published. Allen is also a splendid poet, as you doubtless know.

All good wishes-
