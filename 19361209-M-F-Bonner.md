Dear Madam:—

The K. A. T. authorities, pausing for a moment from their grateful contemplation of newly acquired almanacks, wish to acknowledge with appreciation the message from President Emmerson Thoreau Cornell of the Framingham Chapter, in the Province of the Massachusetts-Bay, as kindly transmitted through you. We are keenly interested in his clever and original lounging-place, and in his sportive gambols with his diminutive testudinate friend. The latter, we are certain, must feel honoured at his choice as boon companion of the snowy and scholarly President Cornell; whilst the strenuousness of the sport cannot but form a salutary influence in combating the natural sluggishness of the reptilian disposition. Messages from President Cornell will always be welcome—and he may rest assured that the picture enclosed in this letter (a view of us when confronted by a long revision job or a volume of Victorian fiction) does *not* represent our attitude in hearing from him.

Nor does it typify our sentiments towards the Hon. James O'Flaherty McCarthy, at whose delicatessen (aven in the ould days phwin it was a branch av Riley's) we have purchased many a pound of cheese and many a slice of veal loaf. Mr. McCarthy's rough exterior would not weigh against him with us—for is not our new chapter president, Thos. Broadbeam—Blackman, Esq., a bit brusque and negligent of the amenities? I am sure that Mr. McCarthy would be a welcome addition to any K. A. T. enterprise! Lorng loives to 'im intoirely!

Yr. most oblig'd and obt. Servt.,  
K. A. T., Providence Chapter

T. Broadbeam-Blackman, Pres't.  
Dan'l Defoe, Vice-President  
H. P. Lovecraft, lib'n. and 3d Asst. Under-Secy.
