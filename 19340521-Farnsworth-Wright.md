My dear Wright:—

I am interested to hear of your plan to reprint the *Arthur Jermyn* tale—which was always one of my favourites. So far as I can recall, Baird made no inexcusable excisions or conspicuous blunders in the text, although he did stick on an outrageously naive and give-away title. The original title of this story was *Facts Concerning the Late Arthur Jermyn and His Family*, although I have always had plain *Arthur Jermyn* in reserve as a possible alternative title. In view of the possible awkwardness of the full title in the table of contents, it might be best for you to call the story just *Arthur Jermyn*. But certainly, I'd like to avoid the inept Baird-given title if it can possibly be managed.

..................

Yrs, most sincerely.
