Dear Rhi'-Mhel:—

I dream of cats very often—did I ever mention any curious dreams about the ancient black sage who used to greet me daily at the entrance of one of the quaint colonial archways on the hill? He died in 1928 at an age substantially over 20 years. Dwyer once had an idea of weaving a story around him. I've dreamed several times about little Sam Perkins, and was pleased to see his name in your new story! The Kappa Alpha Tau are still eloquent in expressing their appreciation of your verses. As for the ill-fortune attending the feline population this autumn—it is really getting to be quite uncanny! The latest victim is the faithful tiger companion of my revision-client Mrs. Heald—who ate some Paris green in the cellar, was seized with a sort of frenzy, and dashed out of the house, never to be seen again. No further reports concerning Doodleby or Gen. Tabasco—alas! But the K. A. T.'s original elders are still flourishing. Owing to the lateness of the season Pres. Randall (whose climatic tastes are like mine) is visible only on exceptional days, but Vice Pres. Osterberg is a fixture at all times. Of late I've seen a stranger about—grey, plump, and rather youngish—but don't know whether he'll be voted in or not. Another new friend of mine—who I think is connected with the University Club at Benefit and Waterman Streets—is quite young and all black except for a small white star on his chest. He follows me quite a way up the hill when I pass his presumable abode, and is the most effusive and amicable of the ankle-rubbers. But I haven't lately seen my huge tiger friend John Quincy Adams at the grocery next the Art Club. He had an accident a year ago, but was supposed to be recovering very nicely from it. Glad to hear that Crom continues to prosper! May he have as long and peaceful a life as Messrs. Randall and Osterberg appear to be having!

Dialect is surely a fascinating study, and leads to all sorts of research. A decade ago I was greatly interested in tracking down some of the idioms I encountered in New York. For example—the phrase "store cheese"—which my palate preferences caused me to run up against continually. In southern New England the expression is—or at least was in 1924—unknown. Our principal cheeses are the large traditional sort—about a foot thick and two feet in diameter—and the modern tinfoil package or process cheeses run second. Thus the word "cheese" without any trimmings suggests to our mind one of the large ordinary old-fashioned sort. When we allude to the new sort we usually say "processed cheese", "package cheese", or (in the case of the long tinfoiled loaf) "loaf cheese". Well—in New York it is just the other way around. The word "cheese" in itself suggests to New Yorkers the modern tinfoil brands, and if you ask for a "pound of mild white cheese" a Manhattan grocer will begin to chop you off a section of a Kraft tinfoiled loaf. These process cheeses (they are artificially cured and not aged) are the principal kinds used in the metropolis, and in many shops no others are obtainable. And where they *do* keep the standard old-fashioned sort, they call them "store cheeses". Thus when I was in Brooklyn I used to have to ak for "medium white *store* cheese" if I expected to get my usual kind. The usage rather puzzled me, so I tried to track it down. I had assumed that it was purely a New York City form, so began enquiring about its use in circles extending gradually outward from the metropolis. I found it common in Newark, Paterson, Yonkers, Stamford, Elizabeth, Perth Amboy, etc. But when I investigated beyond the immediate metropolitan penumbra I felt puzzled. While it gave out in New Jersey and Connecticut, it persisted steadily *up the Hudson*—in Poughkeepsie, Kingston, and even Albany, Troy, and Rensselaer and Washington counties. And to cap the climax, I found it in full blast in *Vermont*—of all places, the *least* likely to be influenced by New York City ..... and the least likely to be overrun by process cheese! Well—this wholly changed my theory. Obviously, the phrase was *not* a Manhattanism, but something from the north which, escaping southern New England, had reached the metropolis through the Hudson River trade route. And so it turned out to be.
"Store cheese" originated some one hundred to one hundred fifty years ago in the zone of colonisation embracing both Vermond and up-state New York. The phrase sprang from a local custom which arose soon before central dairies began to supplant the home making of cheeses—that of making *small* cheeses for private domestic use, and *large* ones to export to shops in the cities and towns. Thus the standard *large* cheese was a *store* cheese; and if a farmer's home-made supply gave out, so that he had to buy a few pounds from a "gin'ral store" at Schuylerville, Perskins' Four Corners, Newfane, or West Brattleboro, he would know that his order would be cut from one of the great cheeses sold to stores. Therefore he would would be apt to say to the rustic or village shopkeeper—"Wal, Zeke, I guess I'll hev to git a couple o' pounds o' yer best yaller *store* cheese, seein' as haow M'randy used up the last o' what we hed in th' haouse fer supper Thusdy." And so the expression "store cheese" arose; inextricably associated with the large two by one foot cheeses of retail commerce. Since Vermont and upper New York traded but little with southern New England, we never acquired the expression; but because of the Hudson River—along which trade and population flowed, and which brought many up-states to New York City—the metropolis acquired it early ... even before the age of tinfoil cheese. It was at first used to distinguish the *then* common large cheeses from the choice potted brands which came in glass or porcelain jars. And so the puzzle was solved. It may be added that the phrase is *very gradually* filtering into southern New England from New York City—aided by the growing prominence of tinfoil cheese, and by the presence of chain store clerks transferred from shops in the areas where it flourished. Where tinfoil cheese is securing the ascendancy, there is a trend toward giving (heretofore) common cheese some distinguished name—and in areas untouched by New York influence I have heard such amusing forms as "*cut* cheese" (Haverhill, Mass.) and even "*cooking* cheese" (A. and P. store in Providence). I have given this small matter in detail as a typical sample of the way dialects are formed and diffused. The small-scale research which I applied to this case must be fairly similar to much of the large-scale research prosecuted by Kurath's continent-wide survey.
