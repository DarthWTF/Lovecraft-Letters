My dear Morse:—

Merritt is certainly great stuff—he has a subtle command of an unique type of strangeness which no one else has been able to parallel. You are absolutely right in considering his original *Moon Pool* novelette—as published in the *All-story* for June 22, 1918—his best work. The sequel—*The Conquest of the Moon Pool*—was relatively commonplace and tainted with the atmosphere of cheap popular fiction. It is a major crime that many of the best touches were taken out of the novelette when it was fused with its sequel to form the ultimate book version. ....

Yrs, most sincerely—
HPL
