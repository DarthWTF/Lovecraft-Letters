February 28, 1937

Jonckheer:—

Yrs of the 15th found me completely knocked out with an acute intestinal trouble following 2 mos. of dragging grippe. Don't know how long or serious an ordeal I'm in for, but Dr. Dustin plans to call in a stomach specialist Tuesday. Am in constant pain, take only liquid food, and so bloated with gas that I can't lie down. Spend all time in chair propped with pillows, and can read or write only a few minutes at a time. Taking 3 medicines at once.

But I must not delay answering yours of the 15th. Thanks immensely for the antiquarian travel bits, and for the *Texaco Star*. No—I didn't get your steel number. The last *Star* I had before this new one was the Texaco Centennial issue.

As for that book proposition—I'm devilish sorry to say that it looks rather stalled. I've had no strength since the middle of December, and could attend only to immediate things. Now it looks as if all bets were off. I've no idea what lies ahead of me—and any systematic effort seems fantastically remote. You and the form are unbelievably kind and liberal—but what can a guy do when he hardly has strength enough to walk across the room? If I ever get through this damned mess, and the firm still feels receptive, we may be able to talk more to the point. All my correspondence and affairs are going to hell, though I'm dropping cards—or having my aunt drop them—in important cases. Hope Belknap's magnum opus will be one of the sensations of 1937. His confidence at least is in his favour.

Good luck with your own pulp experiments. It all depends on what one's basic values and ambitions are. There is certainly vast economic advantage in the pulp field.

Well—I hope all is progressing well with you. Again let me apologise for the apparent letdown, and assure you that the cause is all too adequate. I'll see that you hear of any salient future development.

Blessings and genuflections—  
Grandpa van Kasje
