My dear Rimel:—

.. I left De Land June 21st—the Barlows driving me up to St. Augustine, where I secured a room at the same place I stopped in 1931—overlooking the harbour. I spent a week in the ancient town, and certainly enjoyed it to the limit. ..........

.. Home at last! I found my aunt in excellent health—going everywhere without a cane. And at the boarding-house across the back garden I found something else of infinite interest and grace—the tiny, coal-black survivor of that last month's crop of kittens of which I spoke in my preceding letter. He was then just a wobbly-legged handful. I borrow him continually, and shall try to snap a picture of him before long. He looks like a bear-cat of paper-weight size. Doesn't purr yet, but probably will before long. He's so venturesome in his exploration of walls and steps that he keeps his mother rather worried! I call him Samuel Perkins—and when he grows up he'll doubtless join the Kappa Alpha Tau and sprawl in state amongst the furry dignitaries of the neighbouring shed roof. Meanwhile the remaining February kitten—Betsy Perkins—has grown to be so big that one can scarcely distinguish her from her black-and-white mother .... through she still condescends to seek nourishment from the maternal bosom along with little brother Sam. ...

That anecdote in the Wandrei interview about Cthulhu is largely fictitious. I don't recall anything of the kind, although I probably explained to Wandrei as I have to others that the word is supposed to represent a fumbling human attempt to catch the phonetics of an *absolutely non-human* word. The name of the hellish entity was invented by beings whose vocal organs were not like man's, hence it has no relation to the human speech equipment. The syllables were determined by a physiological equipment wholly unlike ours, *hence could never be uttered perfectly by human throats*. In the story, we have human beings who habitually use the word as best they can ; but all they can do is to *approximate* it. This they accomplish by using their throats in a queer way to intimate the original sound as their ancestors heard it from non-human throats. This queer use of the human throat makes a sound something like the original non-human sound, *but it is not like any human speech or sounds that we commonly hear*. It is an alien, unfamiliar sound that human beings can make only with an effort, and that they would not ever think of making if they were not imitating something non-human. The kind of effort or noise made in this way is *not really like speaking*, but is more like the sound a man makes when he tries to imitate a steam-whistle or crowing rooster or howling wind or neighing horse with his mouth. Up to the time of the story, when Prof. Angell became interested in the matter, there had never been any attempt to render the name of the hellish *R'lyeh* monster in our alphabet—although Abdul Alhazred made an attempt in Arabic letters, which was repeated in Greek by the Byzantine translator. The Latin translator merely copied the Greek. The letters CTHULHU were merely what Prof. Angell hastily devised to represent (roughly and imperfectly, of course) the dream-name orally mouthed to him by the young artist Wilcox. The actual sound—as nearly as human organs could imitate it or human letters record it—may be taken as something like *Khlûl'-hloo*, with the first syllable pronounced gutturally and very thickly. The *u* is about like that in *full*; and the first sullable is not unlike *klul* in sound, since the *h* represents the guttural thickness. The second syllable is not very well rendered—the *l* sound being unrepresented. My rather careful devising of this name was a sort of protest against the silly and childish habit of most weird and science-fiction writers, of having *utterly non-human entities* use a nomenclature *of thoroughly human character*; as if alien-organed beings could possibly have languages based on *human* vocal organs. Actually, every name supposed to have been originated by non-humans should be painstakingly shaped in such a way as *not* to conform to the principles of human vocalism and language.
