YMCA—  
Charleston,  
April 29, '34

Dear Miss Toldridge:—

..........................  
As you have already perceived from the postmark & date-line of this epistle, my southern trip *did* materialise. had a pleasant week in N. Y. with Long & all the old group, & then shot down by 'bus to my favourite of all cities—the ancient & mellow home of "Choir Practice". Reached here at dawn Tuesday. Am stopping at YMCA & absorbing colonial atmosphere as usual. Marvelous place—it certainly excels any other city I have ever seen, even Quebec. And the climate is Superb. I have three times the energy I ever have in the north. Full summer here—rich green vegetation, hot days, straw hats, & all. On to Savannah May 1st, & in De Land, Fla. May 2 unless plans change. Temporary address for a fortnight or so—c/o R. H. Barlow, Box 88, De land, Florida. But I hate to leave old Charleston! On my return trip I may be able to stop off in Washington—I hope so, but can't tell. FInances are embarassingly tight—I never before attempted to cover so much distance on so little cash! A friend in Alacon, Ga. Wants me to visit him, but I doubt if I can do it.

My prospective host is a delightful young fellow—book collector & embryonic weird author. You've probably seen his stuff in the *Fantasy Fan*. His household includes 5 cats & 6 infant *opossums* (whose mother was slain by a motor) which he feeds with a medicine dropper! ....

Best regards—
