Nantucket, Mass.—90 miles from 66 College St.,  
Providence, R. I.

Dear Miss Toldridge:—

.............. Glad you liked *Through the Gates of the Silver Key*—which still fails to satisfy me. It is virtually my own work as it stands. Price wrote a crude sequel to my old *Silver Key* (1926), but it was so false to the spirit of the original that I scrapped almost all of it & wrote the present thing in its place. All that is ,left of Price's work is the mathematical theorising in the middle of the story—plus the scene with the pedestals. And even this has been put into my language. The voyage to Yaddith is entirely my own, in idea & language alike.

Had an enjoyable visit from James F. Morton (curator of the Paterson Museum) August 2-3-4. We visited many local points of interest, & spent the final day at ancient Newport—seeing the U. S. fleet in the harbour, exploring the venerable streets, & walking & resting on the famous ocean cliffs. Morton is getting to be a mighty genealogist, & has just traced the one line which we hold in common (Perkins) back to the year 1380 ... Chaucer's time! He is now in Maine, & Will be circulating around new England till early October.

Of my own recent vacational activities a card & a folder have doubtlessly apprised you. The visit around Boston was highly interesting despite the anxiety caused by Cook's nervous collapse & sudden return to Vermont; but *Nantucket* of course forms the climax. It would take volumes to describe the place—though pictures may help. I enclose a few more. More than Salem, Newport, Marblehead , Portsmouth, or any other town I have ever seen, it represents a typical Yankee seaport of 1790 or 1800 absolutely as it used to be. Horses still numerous—main street paved with huge round cobblestones—skyline dominated by ancient belfries & white steeple—old windmill on the highest hill—gardens & picket fences everywhere—95% of the houses built before 1840 in Georgian style, perhaps 80% antedating 1810 & 40% being pre-revolutionary—narrow winding lanes here & there—knockers & doorplates & horse-blocks & hitching-posts ..... the antiquity is complete! A combination of insular isolation, Commercial collapse, & artistic appreciation has ensured this felicitous survival. Summer visitors & artists now dominate Nantucket, & have done much to preserve its elder-world charm. The town proper has magnificent trees, but the bulk of the island has lost its forests & consists of rolling grassy meadows. .................

As for little Sam Perkins—you ought to seem him *now*! Bless Grandpa's bones, what a little black dynamo of ceaseless sportive energy! Of all little imps of Beelzebub ..... & how he can purr! I have him over at 66 nearly all the time, but his folks don't seem to mind! .......................

I remain yr most oblig'd, most obt Servt
