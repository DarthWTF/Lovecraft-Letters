De Land—

My dear Rimel:-

Your recent recurrent dream of vast wheels and spheres is certainly extraordinary, and I hope you can eventually make literary use of it. The extended cup is surely a tantalising phenomenon. No—I never had any of the fever -dreams (of the turning and rolling of vast bulks) which you mention, though I often dream of things of the most bizarre and vivid sort—some of which I have already incorporated into tales or verses. The only well-defined delirium I ever had was in 1903, when I was twelve years old and suffering from an exaggerated cold. I then (my mother said afterward) mumbled things about flying to Mars and Saturn. As for the nature of dreams—I think there is no question but that they consist of dissociated scraps of previous impressions (some utterly forgotten and ordinarily deeply buried in the subconscious) regrouped by the undisciplined sleeping fancy into new and sometimes utterly unfamiliar forms. Their surface aspect is strange, yet every basic ingredient is something the mind has picked up at one time or another .... from books, pictures, experiences, etc. I don't believe in hereditary memory at all. Acquired characteristics are not ordinarily inherited; and even if they were, they would be merely general tendencies—certainly not the special, individualised impressions involved in that curious sense of unaccountable familiarity which some scenes or dreams awake in us. Yes—I have often had that sense of previous knowledge of things absolutely new to me, but in most cases I have been able to trace it to very early and largely forgotten impressions. For example—a certain village landscape at sunset looked familiar when I first saw it, and I eventually traced it to a picture I had seen in virtual infancy. Vaguer dreams of pseudo-memory—the sort involving strange cyclopean cities—usually refer back to forgotten bits of reading or pictures, more or less combined in a new way. However—for *fictional* purposes it is quite all right to adopt such false but attractive explanations as reincarnation, hereditary memory, and so on. I do myself!

Yrs. most cordially,
