At the Monolith on the Mound
—Hour that the Dogs Howl.  
(circa February 10, 1934)

O Floridian More Fortunate than you Can Realise:—

I write from the captivity to which the Frost-Daemon has consigned me during the worst cold spell in the history of Providence! The minimum so far has been *17 below zero*—by far the lowest figure ever recorded by the local weather bureau, the nearest approach having been during the memorable and terrible winter of 1917-1918. It is really quite unlikely that anything so bad has occurred here since the traditional arctic season of 1778-79, when Narragansett Bay was frozen over, and the Royal troops at Newport nearly perished of cold—notwithstanding that most were Hessians, used to the frigid winters of interior Germany. They had to cut down virtually all the neighboring woods and even tear down old houses to get fuel enough to keep alive—and if this present spell keeps up, I fancy some communities may have to do the same thing! Of course, this would be considered nothing up in Vermont or Quebec—but Rhode Island isn't used to it, hence feels it acutely when it does come once in a while. Of course, I can't go out at all—for 20 above is the lowest temperature at which it's physically safe for me to be out for any length of time. Very fortunately this house—heated with steam piped from the Engineering Bldg. of Brown University—can be kept at a tropical temperature 24 hours a day, my room being 87º at the present moment. I don't know when this epistle will get mailed, for even my aunt (usually a cold-weather shark) shuns the polar waste beyond the front door. But perhaps an accommodating guest, postman, or delivery-man will consent to transmit material to the outside world.
