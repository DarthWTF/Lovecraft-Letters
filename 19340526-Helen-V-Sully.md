Dear Helen:—

It is with vast contrition that I learn of the perilous state in which my Charleston epistle was received ..... a state which I hope may not be duplicated in the present document. If I seem to be tempting fate with the enclosed cards, I may reply that the containing envelope (an honest product of my philanthropic stationer-in-chief, Mr. Frank Winfield Woolworth) is infinitely less likely to succumb to disintegration than were the aging reliquiae of the (to my old correspondents) famous George W. Kirk charity stationery which I have been using for 9 years, & which gave out only during my present season of wandering. Back in 1925 Kirk unloaded on me an infinite number of boxes of envelopes bearing obsolete return addresses—which I thought would last till the end of my, or their, lifetime. As it is, I feel quite bewildered without them—for years I shall be instinctively crossing out an imaginary Kirk inscription in the northwest corner of perfectly blank envelopes! .........................  

I think you are correct in pointing out the element of pompous hyper-criticism in Rachmaninoff's remarks on the infant prodigy. To my mind it is exceedingly foolish to discourage or resent early development in the darts. When such occurs, there is generally a natural & adequate reason for it—not is any advantage likely to result from its checking. The only thing I would tend to oppose is *forcing* as opposed to reasonable *encouragement*. A child should never be robbed of the period of care-free play & leisure which not only belongs to it by right, but is really important to it subsequent psychological & emotional equilibrium. Nearly all *forced* prodigies tend to develop ill-proportioned personalities which peter out disappointingly—cases in point being the well-known ones of William Sidis & Winifred Sackville Stoner, Jr. But of course there are cases where the child's natural recreative impulse is in the same direction as its serious talents—permitting a rapid & intensive development without undue forcing. I trust that the small & gifted Ruth may be able to triumph over parentage, overtraining, & criticism alike.

Regarding the parallelism—in some cases amounting to actual organic relationship—betwixt poetry & music, I cannot speak with any authority because of my musical ignorance. I would, however, tend to say (or guess) that the two arts each have certain phases or departments of the other. Though the primary bases of the two are widely different, the common elements of rhythm & association create large overlapping zones. Despite my vast ignorance, there are musical compositions which tend to evoke from my imagination certain definitely *visual* concepts which could be expressed (had one had the skill) either in poetry or painting. And conversely, there are imaginative phases of poetry which seem to suggest paintings or musical notes—& aspects of painting which suggest music or poetry or both. The fact is, that all the arts would seem to be fundamentally related despite their profound differences in function & method. Each expresses a certain side of a single definite quality of the mind of highly evolved animal life, a quality best expressed as *a demand for the perception of modulated symmetry*. In practice, of course, this purely aesthetic demand is always mixed to an indefinite & inextricable degree with various factors of *association*, emotional & intellectual. Thus I cannot help viewing a familiar landscape both as a loyal native & as an aesthetic appreciator, while historical & antiquarian interests creep into my appreciations of architecture. These associative elements heighten the poignancy of all artistic appeal; & it is both silly & pedantic to try to role them out absolutely, as many moderns do. I have no use at all for the theoretical abstract art of futurists, functionalists, & kindred spawn of a sterile & disintegrative modernism. Art without tradition is only a crippled & impoverished remnant—& I hope that no freakish social overturn will ever be allowed to wreck Western Europe's mainstream. But I digress loquaciously, as usual!

As for travelling economies—dietary & otherwise—bless my soul, but I don't starve on my $1.75 hebdomadal nutritive quota! It is merely a matter of reducing poverty to a science & extracting a maximum return from a minimum expenditure. My arbitrary minimum quota on trips like this is 25¢ per day—& it is astonishing how far this can be made to go. ... Two meals a day are all I ever eat under any circumstances, & ... I can always omit a meal without feeling any difference. So there is no need for the children to have any anxiety over Grandpa's health! The hold gentleman has grown into a relatively tough bird in his sunset years—& such selective diets do not even begin to exercise a strain on his time-weathered constitution! I have to go below this quantity level whenever I want to knock off a few pounds of my weight. Just now, amidst the lavish & gratuitous fare provided by my present genial hosts, the peril is all in the opposite direction—if I escape without indigestion & a double chin I shall be fortunate indeed!

After an overnight pause in Jacksonville, I reached De Land at noon May 2, & was met by my gifted young host—a great admirer & correspondent of Klarkash-Ton, by the way. De Land is a modern town which owes all its beauty to its fine subtropical setting—live-oaks, moss, magnolias, &c.—& I will avoid tedious descriptions by sending under separate cover an illustrated folder for your gradually growing travel morgue. The Barlow place is 14 miles west of the village, & out of sight of any other human habitation—in a pleasant landscape of blue lakes & tall Australian pines that stand out against the sunset like the trees in a Japanese print. The house—scarcely completed as yet—is of rustic design with log exterior .... of two stories, & very appropriate landscaping under direction of the youthful heir. In the rear is a delectable pine-fringed lakelet on which we row almost daily, & across which is a fine oak grove suitable for outdoor reading & writing sessions. A cabin will eventually be built in this grove—& my young host urges Grandpa to move down & permanently inhabit it! The climate is admirable—85º to 90º day after day, & no chill spells at this season, I feel like a new person—as spry as a youth, & without a trace of the usual trouble which besets me in the north. I go hatless & coatless, & am maintaining an admirable layer of tan. Snakes abound to a picturesque degree; & young Barlow shoots them for their skin—which he uses in amateur bookbinding. The other day I saw him bag a coach-whip snake all of 7 feet long.

As for my host—Robert Heyward Barlow—he is obviously not the Richard you knew, nor can he place that person as a distant kinsman. But he surely is a great boy. He always evaded statements regarding his age, but it now turns out that he *only turned sixteen last Friday*. The little imp! Thus he was scarcely 13 when he first corresponded with me. But for the handicap of poor eyesight (which he will try to have corrected on a northern trip next Autumn—when he will meet Belknap & the N. Y. gang) he might be a worthy parallel of the unpronounceably surnamed Ruth in his differing lines of endeavour! never before in the course of a long lifetime have I seen such a versatile child. He is a writer; painter; sculptor; printer; pianist; marrionette designer, maker, & exhibitor; landscape gardener; tennis champion; chess expert; bookbinder; crack rifleshot; bibliophile; manuscript collector; & heaven knows what else! You ought to see the bas-relief of one of my fictional monsters (*Cthulhu*) which he made some time ago from common Florida clay—that & the statuette of the elephant god Ganesa (prototype of Belknap's *Chaugnar*) which he is making for an amiable eccentric old fellow (William Lumley—also a correspondent of Klarkash-Ton's) in Buffalo, N. Y.! Bobby is the younger son of a retired army colonel now nervously broken down & visiting relatives in the North. He has a brother a decade older than himself—an army lieutenant at present stationed in Texas. It develops, amusingly enough, that we have a strain of ancestry in common—both having descended from the Rathbones of Block Island, R. I. The present household, in addition to little Ar-Ech-Bei & the felidae & opossumlet, consists of Mrs. Barlow, an elderly housekeeper, & the latter's really gifted middleaged son—Charles Blackburn Johnston—whose paintings excite my unaffected envy. The Johnstons are *Virginians* of rustic origin, & speak a broad southern dialect.

Among our diversions have been several trips to ancient places of the sort I dote upon ..... including a Spanish sugar-mill at De Leon Springs which antedates 1763 (vide enc.), & sundry sites & reliques at New Smyrna on the coast. New Smyrna is celebrated as the seat of Dr. Andrew Turnbull's plantation of 1768, where indigo & other subtropical products were cultivated by labourers (Minorcan Spaniards, Italians, & Greeks) imported from the Mediterranean. It was named in honour of Dr. Turnbull's wife—a Greek gentlewoman from Smyrna. After some success, the enterprise failed through labour troubles resulting from over-strict overseers—the workmen being finally (1774) released from their indentures & settled in St. Augustine (where their descendants still live) by order of his Britannick Majesty's governor. Turnbull's ruin was completed by the re-cession of Florida to Spain in 1783. he then went to Charleston & became the leading apothecary there—founding a pharmacy at the corner of King & Broad Sts. which yet survives, & at which I have frequently purchased vanilla ice-cream. Of the Turnbull plantation no trace survives save an old irrigation canal, which still runs its course beside new Smyrna's main street. A more picturesque New Smyrna relique is the vine-clad, oak-shaded ruin of a Franciscan mission built in 1696, partly destroyed by South Carolina troops in 1706, later used as a sugar mill, & finally abandoned. Many stately walls & noble arches of coquina stone remain—the effect of the whole, in conjunction with the tropical background & marks of the jungle's reconquest, being picturesque & exotic to the highest degree. ....................

By the way—I trust you did not miss a glimpse of the dashing E. Hoffman Price when he recently rolled up in his well-seasoned tree-climbing Juggernaut to pay his respects to Klarkash-Ton. A fascinating chap—you may recall my mentioning his presence in providence just prior to your own advent there. He is now settled (as long as he can settle anywhere) at his parental home in Oakland Cal.—& it is likely that the recent visit to Averoigne will not be his last. ..............

With every good wish,
