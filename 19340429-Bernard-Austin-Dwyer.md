Hail, O BuãdvãeAã!

..... A $1.75 per week eating programme is easy if you know how to manage it. It means merely keeping down to a quarter a day, and I can do that without half trying. When restaurants are high, I fall back on canned and packaged goods—knife, fork, spoon, and a can opener being with me. A 5¢ package of ginger wafers is more than sufficient breakfast, while a 10¢ can of spaghetti or beans will do for dinner—with the residue of the cookies for dessert. That's only 15¢—leaving a margin for luxury on other days. Coffee can be cut out—it isn't much for *nourishment* anyhow—or at 5¢ a cup it isn't a great item at worst. In Charleston the cheap lunch rooms are so incredibly reasonable that I don't have to resort to "home cooking". I follow either one of two plans. Sometimes I get a dime's worth of ice-cream for breakfast, and a 10¢ bowl of Mexican chili con carne (with lots of crackers) and coffee for dinner. Total for the day, 25¢. Or else I cut out the breakfast altogether and stuff up at night on the incredible 25¢ *bargain dinner* provided at the Mexican Chili Place in Marion Sq. Boy, what a gorge for a quarter! It couldn't be approached in the north—Jake or no Jake! Not only is it a full feast, but a choice of three meats is offered. Last night I had the following Lucullan trough-fest .... and all for one solitary quarter: pork sausage (generous allotment), fried potato, huge mountain of hominy, load of beets, two corn biscuits and butter, coffee, and bread pudding. Can you beat it? I fear it will set back my reducing—although I've knocked off 4lbs. since last Sunday, when I bade farewell to the dangerous luxury of the Long board. (By the way—my Y room is only $3.75 per week.)
