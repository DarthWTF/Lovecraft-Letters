My dear Rimel:-

... *Pickman's Model* describes the Boston North End as it was until a few years ago, though many of these old tangled alleys have now been swept away by civic change-the ancient houses demolished, and warehouses erected on their site. I remember when the precise location of the artist's house in the story was hit by the razing process. It was in 1927, and Donald Wandrei (whose stories you probably know, and who was then living in his home town of St. Paul, Minn., though he is now in N. Y.) was visiting the East for the first time. He wanted to see the site of the story, and I was very glad to take him to it-thinking that its sinister quaintness would even surpass his expectations. Imagine my dismay, then, at finding nothing but a blank open space where the tottering old houses and zigzag alley-windings had been! It took me all more aback because they were still there as late as the preceding summer. Well-Wandrei had to accept my word about what had been there, although we could still trace the course of the principal cobblestoned lane among the gaping foundation walls. A year later the whole thing was covered up with a great brick building. In Brooklyn, the Red Hook section described in my story is probably about the same as it was. I haven't been there in years, but I doubt if any demolition or development process has been inaugurated. When you come to read *The Shunned House* you'll see a description of an old Providence district not far from where I live-a Benefit St. neighborhood halfway down the hill and several blocks north of here. ... The graveyard in *The Unnamable* is really the old Charter St. Burying Ground in Salem. There *is* an old house abutting on it (also mentioned by Hawthorne in *Dr. Grimshawe's Secret*), with a cracked tomb nearby; and there is also a huge willow engulfing an illegible slab near the centre of the cemetery. *From Beyond*, like *The Nameless City*, was rejected by all the paying magazines. Hope the rest of the Yuggothian Fungi won't disappoint you. By the way-as to those artificial names of unearthly places and gods and persons and entities-there are different ways of coining them. To a large extent they are designed to suggest-either closely or remotely-certain names in actual history or folklore which have weird or sinister associations connected with them. Thus "Yuggoth" has a sort of Arabic or Hebraic cast, to suggest certain words passed down from antiquity in the magical formulae contained in Moorish and Jewish manuscripts. Other synthetic names like "Nug" and "Yeb" suggest the dark mysterious tone of Tartar or Thibetan folklore. Dunsany is the greatest of all name-coiners, and he seems to have three distinct models-the Oriental (either Assyrian or Babylonian, or Hebrew from the Bible), the classical (from Homer mostly), and the Celtic (from the Arthurian cycle, etc.). Thus he invents Eastern-sounding words like "Gyshaw", "Sardathrion", "Bethmoora", etc., Hellenistic terms like "Argimenes", "Poltarnees", etc., and pseudo-Celtic names like "Arleon" and "Camorak". I myself sometimes follow Dunsany's plan, but I also have a way strictly my own-which I use for devising *non-human* names, as of the localities and inhabitants of other planets. It is clear (though most writers fail to realise it) that the language supposed to be used by non-earthly beings-without human vocal organs and with no knowledge of terrestrial traditions-*ought not to resemble human speech in any way*. The sounds ought not to follow any human language-pattern, and ought not to be derived from-or adapted to-the human speech-equipment at all. In other words, the whole design ought to be alien to both the ideas and tongue of mankind-a series of sounds of altogether different origins and associations, and capable only in part of reproduction by the human throat and palate and mouth. Just how far, and in what direction, such a sound-system ought to differ from human speech, must of course depend on how far and in what direction the imaginary users are represented as differing. In representing such sounds on paper, it is of course understood that our Roman alphabet can do it only imperfectly-since that alphabet was designed for a human language. usually my stories assume that the non-human sounds were known to certain human scholars in elder days, and recorded in secret manuscripts like the *Necronomicon*, the *Pnakotic Manuscripts*, etc. In that case I likewise assume that the prehistoric or ancient authors of these manuscripts gave the non-human names an unconscious twist in the direction of their own respective languages-as always occurs when scholars and writers encounter an utterly alien nomenclature and try to represent it to their own people. Thus when I cite the name of some wholly non-human thing *supposed to be mentioned in the Necronomicon*, I try to have the *foundation* of the word absolutely unearthly and alien, yet give it an outwardly *Arabic* aspect to account for the transmitting influence of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred. Typical *Necronomicon* names are *Azathoth*, *Yog-Sothoth*, *Shub-Niggurath*, etc. Often Clark Ashton Smith (who is almost as fertile name-creator as Dunsany!) and I try to give different *variants* of the same unearthly or prehistoric name to represent the different variants under which different races refer to the same thing as remembered from primitive times ..... as, for instance, some Nordic races spoke of *Odin* and *Freya* while others spoke of *Woden* and *Frigga*, or as the Hindoo *DYaus-Pitar* became the Roman *Iuppiter*. Thus I have had *Yog-Sothoth* occur (in a story I wrote for a client) as *Yog-Sototl* among the Aztecs, while Smith (borrowing it from me) has coined the mediaeval form *Iog-Sot√¥t* for his mythical *Averoigne*. And he has used his own *Tsathoggua* in various forms such as the pseudo-mediaeval *Sodagui*, etc. Many realists violently object to the practice of using these coined names, averring that it gives a childish effect to the stories concerned. I can see their point, but do not think their objection can be applied indiscriminately. Carelessly, injudiciously coined, or excessively used artificial names do rather cheapen a tale; but it is certainly advantageous now and then to introduce a coined word which has been shaped with great care from just the right associational sources. At times I have *dreamt* certain utterly alien names such as *Kuranes*, *Nasht*, and *Kaman-Thah*-all of course having vague linguistic sources in things I have read. As for writing out the hellish and forbidden *Necronomicon*-that would be quite an order, though I might manage to produce an isolated chapter now and then. Incidentally, anent the synthetic names we use so much, Clark Ashton Smith and I call each other Klarkash-Ton and Ech-Pi-El. I once built up a whole cycle of legend around Smith's *Tsathoggua* and used it in a story I re-wrote for a revision client, but unfortunately the story was rejected.\*\*
