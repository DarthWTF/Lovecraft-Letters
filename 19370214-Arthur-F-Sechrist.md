Dear Ar-Eph-Es:—

Still more congratulations on the new feline member of the household—who may, I trust, grow up to be as revered a matriarch as Mrs. Spotty Perkins (mother of my late friend Samuel and John Perkins, and the Earl of Minto) at the boarding-house across the garden. Glad the newcomer gets along well with the younger generation—and imagine that the latter will take much delight in her presence. As for the matter of *demonstrativeness*—I've never given it much attention, since the most I ask of a feline colleague is just to be around and look graceful. However, I fancy most cats become more or less visibly attached to those who pay them attention and treat them with scrupulous consideration. I am so fond of cats that I can't help making a great deal of them, and they usually seem to recognise me as a sort of natural friend. I always play with them extensively—usually with a long, slender branch, or a spool or piece of paper on the end of a strong. A hassock is a great aid to feline sport—using it as a screen or barrier behind which to draw ... slowly and tantalisingly .. the spool on which one's furry playmate's eyes are interestedly centred. Cats also enjoy *tunnels* formed of rugs or newspapers. One favourite pastime of theirs is to leap at anything which moves or bulges mysteriously beneath a covering—as a hand creeping under a rug and forming  a curious moving mountain. Considerate attention always pleases a cat. I never evict one from a chair, or disturb his slumbers or repose. People have compared me to Mohammed, who once cut off the loose part of one of his sleeves rather than disturb the cat who had curled up to sleep on it. Tones of voice are likewise influential. I always talk to cats individually, and in accents of such obvious friendliness that they seem to recognise me as a fraternity-brother. And I always acknowledge gestures of consideration on their part—talking pleasantly, stroking them, or scratching them gently under the chin when they jump in my lap, rub around my ankles, or otherwise express esteem. I am also generous with catnip, keeping a supply always on hand for the regaling of my favourite callers. I generally scatter it on an outspread newspaper in a certain spot on the floor—and my friends have come to know the old gentleman so well that they always make for that spot without delay upon entering Grandpa's study. In the end, an average kittie will always be notably friendly toward any person whom he can remember as always speaking and acting considerately, and never speaking or acting harshly. When I moved to \#66 there was a fine old neighbor cat (now, alas, moved away) whose fear of strangers was notorious. However—beginning with friendly discourse at a distance I had the old fellow in three months so that he would roll over on my approach and play like a kitten! Good old Peter Randall! I certainly miss him now that I no longer see him and his brother sprawled on the shed roof beneath my window!

All good wishes—  
Yrs. most sincerely—
