My dear Rimel:—

..............  
......... A little over a decade ago I grew uncomfortably fat through the overeating habits urged on me by a solicitous family who sought to combat my lack of ravenous appetite—but in 1925 I inaugurated a record-breaking reducing campaign and knocked off fifty pounds in five mounths. Now I keep track of my diet and have no tendency to pile on the suet again. I must have shot above two hundred in 1924 ... I stopped getting weighed when I went over one hundred eighty-eight. My collar size, now 14¼, shot up to 16¼! ......

.. The boat sounds interesting—I used to row considerably on the Seekonk, which you'll find on your city map ... and also on general maps of R. I. Often I would land on one or both of the Twin Islands—for islands 9associated with remote secrets, pirate treasure, and all that) always fascinated me. I have occasionally found arrowheads—for R. I. was the core of the Narragansett country—but for petrified wood I had to depend on my grandfather's collection. ........  
....

Yrs. most sincerely—  
Ech-Pi-El
