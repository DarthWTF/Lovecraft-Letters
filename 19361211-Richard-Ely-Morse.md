Dear R-Em:—

..........

Human linkages with remote ages are highly fascinating to contemplate, and it is astonishing how few links are sometimes required (if certain very old persons happened, and when very young, to talk with very old persons) to bridge the gap between the present and various remote stages of the past. The comparative rarity of centenarians makes my own case—that is of talking with an eighteenth century survivor although born ninety years after the close of that century—distinctly uncommon; but I have seen much more spectacular linkages reported. Only a few years ago I read an article about living persons who have talked with those holding memories of the eminent figures of the Elizabethan age—which is of course by now means anomalous when we reflect that elderly people today may well have talked with persons born around 1780, who in turn may well have talked with survivors of the 1690 generation, who in their turn can easily have known elders born around 1600 and remembering Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, Beaumont, Fletcher, Sir Walter Raleigh, or even Queen Elizabeth herself. It all depends on whether those who reach a great age have happened in their early childhood, to meet persons of equally great age. ... I was always fascinated by the fact that one of my old correspondents—the homespun poet Jonathan E. Hoag of Greenwich, N. Y., who died at the age of ninety-six in 1927—had listened in his early childhood to a great-aunt who remembered the terrible massacre by Montcalm's unmanageable Indian allies at Fort William Henry, N. Y., in 1757, during the old French War—the theme of Cooper's *Last of the Mohicans*. That was surely getting back to the past! I never met Mr. Hoag in person, although James F. Morton did. *Time* is surely a fascinating and terrible thing. Some day—towards the end of the present century—people will listen eagerly to the few centenarians left from my generation—a generation able to remember the deceptive surface tranquility of that pre-war world which was really the final phase of a European civlisation dating from the Renaissance and founded on the bourgeois rule of an agricultural-handicraft society. No one born since 1905 or so can ever have known the full smugness and naive optimism prevailing in that idyllic fools' paradise—that world whose securities were all anchored in conditions forever vanished. The rude suddenness of the awakening has created a line of sharp cleavage seldom met with in history—so that persons still in their middle years are waxing oracular and sentimental after the fashion of Melmoths or Wandering Jews who have lived from one age into another. Thus Henry Seidel Canby in his reminiscent *Harper's* articles (now made into a book), and Carl Van Doren in his *Three Worlds*.

Yrs. most sincerely—
