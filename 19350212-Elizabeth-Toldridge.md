Dear Miss Toldridge:—

..................... Incidentally—at this writing I am looking out the window into a sunset as mystically glamourous as any which could have inspired the poem ..... orange, rose, & *green* all curiously mingled in wavy lines behind a pair of ancient church towers, with a distant, needle-like steeple (on a hill 2 or 3 miles away) in the far distance. And some of the lights of the lower town are winking on .... as my desk light will have to do very shortly if this script is to remain even partly legible!

*later—lights on*  
I waited to watch the rest of the sunset—utterly magnificent! The rose & green gave place to crimson & orange—one vast sea welling up from the violet horizon. And the evening star blazed over the city's tallest tower. ..............

Wretched weather hereabouts—the snowstorm of Jany. 23-4 paralysed local traffic for days, & has not yet melted off. Cold days in continuous succession—so that I've been outdoors only on rare occasions. I did, though, manage to attend two of the poetry readings by authors at the college—Susanna Valentine Mitchell (now of Prov.) & Archibald MacLeish (author of *Conquistador*) Both were excellent—& MacLeish comes about as near to a major poet as this hemisphere can now boast. Hope Hornig is straightening out your *FF* subscription—I dropped him a line about it. Which reminds me—did I send you the amateur paper containing my *Homes & Shrines of Poe?* If not, let me know, & I will do so. Little Barlow, by the way, has just sent me a fine edition of Poe's tales with fantastic illustrations by Harry Clarke.

E. Hoffman Price has bought a cottage atop a wooded hill near Red-wood City, California-in sight of the southern part of San Francisco Bay. He has also acquired a marvellous white cat—a mighty hunter who claws gophers out of their holes & brings them for his master to see before devouring them. Price has appropriately named him Nimrod. He simply strayed in one day & shewed an inclination to remain ... previous history unknown!

Glad you can get glimpses of the moon. This study has some fine moon-vistas—last week I caught the infinitely thin crescent in the west just after new moon. Last Sunday evening I was all ready to watch the occultation of the Pleiades, but clouds malignly intervened. ............

Glad Little Bobby drops in now & then. A truly brilliant kid!  
All good wishes—
