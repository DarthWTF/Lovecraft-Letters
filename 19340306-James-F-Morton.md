Candent Convert to Connubial Catenation:—

.............

I lately read the celebrated *Anthony Adverse* (lent by Dwyer)—taking five days to plough my leisurely course through its 1224 pages. I presume it might have taken you all of three hours to cover that much ground. The thing gives quite a picture of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, tho' it is indubitably overrated. A bit mawkish. and heavy with bald philosphick speculation. other recent items on my calendar are Dunsany's new book—*The Curse of the Wise Woman*—Weigall's *Wanderings in Roman Britain*, and A. Merrit's old yarn *The Metal Monster*, which I had never read before because Eddy told me it was dull. The damn'd fool! (nephew—not our late bibliophilick friend) Actually, the book contains the most remarkable presentation of the *utterly alien and non-human* that I have ever seen. I don't wonder that Merritt calls it his "best and worst" production. The human characters are commonplace and wooden—just pulp hokum—but the *scenes and phaenomena* .... oh, boy! ...

Blessings—
