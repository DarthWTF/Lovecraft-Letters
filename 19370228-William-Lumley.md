Dear Mr. Lumley:—

... I am surely sorry to hear of your poor health, which is at present more or less paralleled by my own. My persistent touch of grippe—or whatever it is—keeps my digestion in very bad shape, and I have no strength at all. All I can do is to attend to a few insistent matters and get out for brief afternoon walks when it is warm enough. .. Letter delayed. Am now acutely ill with intestinal trouble following grippe. No strength—constant pain. Bloated with gas and have to sit and sleep constantly in chair with pillows. Doctor, is going to call in a stomach specialist on Tuesday. So I fear I shan't be able to do much for a long time to come.
