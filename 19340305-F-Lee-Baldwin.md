My dear Mr. Baldwin:-

..... No, long letters never bore me-& I only hope that my own do not bore my correspondents. I lean to the habits of my favourite 18th century in doing a good deal of letter writing. While you are probably right in deeming organised correspondence clubs (where writing must be more or less trivial & perfunctory, I imagine) rather futile, I believe that a really intelligent epistolary contact with persons in widely different regions can sometimes be a very valuable broadening & maturing influence. Only the exceptional individual can have face-to-face contact with enough varied types to give him a representative idea of his own civilisation as a whole, yet with the aid of letters he can exchange opinions & perspectives with minds of every sort. I have found this so myself. As a person of very retired life, I met very few different sorts of people in youth-& was therefore exceedingly narrow & provincial. Later on, when literary activities brought me into touch with widely diverse types by mail-Texans like Robert E. Howard, men in Australia, New Zealand, &c., Westerners, Southerners, Canadians, people in old England, & assorted kinds of folk nearer at hand-I found myself opened up to dozens of points of view which would otherwise never have occurred to me. My understanding & sympathies were enlarged, & many of my social, political, & economic views were modified as a consequence of increased knowledge. Only correspondence could have effected this broadening; for it would have been impossible to have visited all the regions & met all the various types involved, while books can never talk back or discuss. Even as it is, I realise my broadening is only partial-since it does not extend outside the English-speaking world. But at least my perspective & sense of proportion are just a bit improved. However-I realise that such a broadening could never have resulted from a merely casual & promiscuous correspondence. The only correspondence worth having is with persons who really have something to say to one. When an individual has certain highly specialised & uncommon tastes-as, for example, an interest in weird fiction-it almost always requires correspondence to put him in touch with enough people of like tastes to form a circle of discussion. It isn't likely that one could ever encounter more than one or two others with such exceptional tastes within the relatively narrow circle of personal acquaintance in one geographic locality. ....

With every good wish-yrs. most sincerely,
H. P. Lovecraft
