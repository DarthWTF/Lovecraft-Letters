Dear Ar-Ech-Bei:—

......  
.. As for my diet—Admission fees, booklets, and cards have so crippled my purse that I'm down to the canned goods and cookie diet which I described to you. Today my total food bill has been 16¢, as follows: Dinner: can beans 6¢. ½ pkg. ginger wafers 2½¢. Total dinner, 8½¢. Supper: ½ pkg. ginger wafers 2½¢, 1 cup ice cream 5¢. Total 7½¢. Total for the day 16¢. yesterday I went up to 20¢, since Heinz Spaghetti is 10¢ per can. In this way I can get by quite fairly—and I'll follow the same programme elsewhere. At 20¢ a day, my weekly food bill is only $1.40 instead of the previously allowed $1.75. And the 6¢ beans occasionally bring it under even this modest figure! Study your grandpa's methods and learn how to live cheaply!
