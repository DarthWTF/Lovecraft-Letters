The Antient Hill

Invincible Booleywag:—

.... I read the old *Communist Manifesto* many years ago; & even though then wholly out of sympathy with it, was impressed by some of the isolated points it brought out. Today I would sympathise on more counts—but even so, would not give it a 100% endorsement. There is no question of the vast intelligence & far-sightedness of Marx & Engels, & of the basic importance of the large economic principles they discovered & formulated. The only mistake is to think that every ramification they developed, & every inference they drew, is infallibly accurate & worthy of slavishly literal following under every conceivable set of circumstances. The major discovery as to general drift is sound—but the derived system of "dialectical materialism" with its fantastic economic interpretations of everything, its linkages of totally dissimilar fields (art, science, &c.) with economics, & its assumptions (disregarding dozens of potent historic & psychological factors) of the utter inevitability of certain courses, is no more to be accepted uncritically than are the kindred philosophic generalisations of the mediaeval schoolmen. Some people seem never able to realise that no great discovery comes forth without attendant clouds of error & half truth. The biological deductions of Darwin were *essentially* sound—though they included many minor slips & ignored important factors later discovered. The psychological principles of Freud are fundamentally important—but they are overlaid with provoking amounts of bias & absurdity. So with Marx. The essence of his discovery is of deep & permanent value; but in building upon it both he & others were occasionally misled by a variety of inevitable factors—ethical feeling, lack of foreknowledge of mechanical developments, lack of psychological & historical perspective, irrelevant traditions of preëxisting radicalism, &c. &c. The notion of international commerce as a pacificator is patently falacious—while the dictum that revolution would come first in a highly industrialised country has been directly reversed by facts. The notion of the community of women is a mere dream of irresponsible extremists—repudiated by Russia, & today probably held by nobody save the Spanish anarchists. Actually, no theory ought to be followed in planning the future of a state. Each nation & culture-stream has different desires & needs & habitual methods; & we should consult theories only in seeking guidance as to the most practicable means of attaining the individual goals chosen by each ...... provided, of course, such goals are not at variance with the obviously universal principle that every citizen of a state has a right to a job affording decent self-support.

As to the question of whether the whole western world is facing the ultimate alternative of communism or "fascism" (as that term is understood at the moment)—I think it is yet early to decide, despite certain indications in that direction. Local habits of thought & action play a great part, & the Northern nations with their long-standing traditions of *gradualism* might well stand apart from the world of totalitarian disctatorships even if France were swept in. A good deal depends on the extent to which normal evolution is opposed by the reactionary classes. If the old plutocrats can keep their senses about them, & realise that they must relinquish their special privileges one by one, there is distinct hope for orderly progress. If they don't, then one must expect that irrational & violent tactics, likely to end in communism, will be used against them. The nations of Scandinavia form a very hopeful sign—for there the plutocrats are gradually backing down under the combined pressure of increased government supervision & the competing system of consumers' coöperatives. England is also well on the way. The United States has the handicap of a lawless pioneer tradition which exalts in individual gain to a grotesque extent—but even here the Northern-European temperament has softened the savagery of reaction. We do not find—except among a few blustering old-timers, the old women of the D. A. R., & certain backward fundamentalists of the Ku Klux or Black Legion calibre

Reaction—despite temporary sports—is slowly giving ground among North-Europeans; & I believe that only some unforeseen retardation, or some disastrous involvement in a new world war, will check the gradual movement toward some reasonably rational & more or less socialistic form of political-economic organisation. ..............
