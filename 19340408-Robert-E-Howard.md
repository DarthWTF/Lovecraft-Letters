Dear Ar-I--E'ch:—

As for the constitution—all one may ask is whether or not our revered Sacred Cow of 1789, written before any of our present economic and social conditions were ever dreamed of, interferes with the stern and necessary task of creating an economic order capable of giving every man a chance to earn his living if it does not interfere with that task, then let it alone. It has valuable points as well as many irrelevant and obsolete points. But if it *does* interfere with that task—a task undoubtedly demanding some governmental checks on business unforeseen in 1789—then the only thing to do is to ignore or amend it. It is more important to restore earning power to the people than to follow out literally some now irrelevant precepts written 145 years ago in a vanished world. If a constitution is to be of any use, it must have some reference to the conditions of the age. To amend the hoary document in certain necessary places would not mean the destruction of the basic spirit in which it was conceived.

Government certainly has a devil of a struggle ahead of it. Every move ahead in the direction of a more equitable and humane order will undoubtedly be fought tooth and nail by the blindly selfish interests of the old decaying order, so that each change will have to come slowly. Moreover—there are always the well-meant protests of individualists who resent the regulation needed to restore opportunity to the whole population. These latter don't seem to realise that governmental oversight doesn't *destroy* opportunity, but rather *restores* opportunity previously destroyed by other forces. A laissez-faire policy means merely a hidden control by great industrial and financial interests. To fight this *natural result of technical "freedom"* it is worth while to yield a bit of the technical article. That is the only way we can hope to get a bit of the freedom which is real ...... freedom to live and think outside the shadow of imminent want and suffering, and outside the prison of paralysing overwork. But what a job! After the new system is won, then will come the problem of how to run it—and here again will be the turmoil and squabbling and indecision, ..

Quite an amusing debate is going on over the original German Title of our old friend von Junzt's Nameless Cults. You'll recall that I got the rendering *Unaussprechlichen Kulten* from young Derleth—who ought to know, being one of a compact German-American community. Price, however, was not satisfied with the translation, and finally decided that *Unnennbaren Kulten* is probably more exact—but *Unaussprechlichen* has such a sinister, mouth-filling rythm that it seems almost a pity to let it go if it can be found in any way usable. I think I told you that a coming story in W. T., which I ghost-wrote for a client, will revolve to a very great extent around a certain ritual in the hellish Black Book.
