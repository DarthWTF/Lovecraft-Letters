Dear Mr. Eshbach:—

... Your suggestion that I contribute something is indeed flattering, and I fervently wish I had something suited to the *Galleon's* requirements. If weird material of substantial length were acceptable, I would promptly inundate you—but alas! in all my existence I have never written a story which was *not* weird! ...

Yrs. most cordially,  
H. P. Lovecraft
