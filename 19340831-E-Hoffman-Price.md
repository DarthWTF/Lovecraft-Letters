Ancient Nantucket—  
Aug. 31, 1934

Dear Malik:—

And what a place is Nantucket! I *thought* I had seen something of colonial antiquity before—but just wait till I take you and old Jug to this utterly unchanged fragment of early America! Ædepol! There is absolutely nothing else like it—and to think I never visited it before .... a place only 90 miles (6 hrs. by coach and ship) from my own door! Compared with this town Providence and St. Augustine and the Vieux Carré are positively modernistic! Whole networks of cobblestoned streets with nothing but colonial houses on either side—narrow garden-bordered lanes—ancient belfries—picturesque waterfront—*everything* that the antiquarian could ask! I'm seeing the whole thing in a week's sojourn. Have a 3d story room at the Overlook (an ancient tavern with small-paned windows, etc.), with a splendid view of town and harbour and sea. I've explored old houses, the 1746 windmill, the Hist. Soc. Museum, the whaling museum, etc.—and am doing every inch of the quaint streets and alleys on foot. ..

.. What I know of detailed human activities is very slight—and what I care about them is slighter still, except so far as the element of historic pageantry is concerned. Nothing but the element of *nature-defiance*—especially *time*-defiance—sets off the spring that starts my creative imagination running. Of the crime and drunken hilarity and inane amusements of modern urban life nothing captivates my fancy. Set the calendar back a century and bring in some even involving old Nantucket or Providence or Charleston life, and my interest grows—since the drama of the time-stream will then figure—but even then my knowledge and technique are insufficient for the task of handling. If I *could* grind out unconvincing hokem to order I certainly *would*—but I know, after repeated experiments dating from 1921, that I can't. The element of *interest* plays a larger part in even the most mechanical hack writing than is commonly supposed. Take that out, and even the most industrious artisan is at least partly stalled. Also—the ambition to write seriously is a handicap to the hack. I think that, as a rule, the most successful hacks are those who stick to their trade with no thought of literary creation. Some can bridge the gulf, but the average plodder can be only one or the other—a pulp-producer or a serious writer. The writer must have no thought for either finances (in connexion with writing) or public demand. To him there are only two elements—what he has to say and how he wants to say it. His only concern is for *intrinsic excellence*—regardless of returns or popular taste. Literarily, the only thing for me to do just now is to keep quiet. I must try to get more leisure from correspondence and revision, and avoid the sort of nervous collapse that I used to have—and that Cook still has. First of all, to dispose of the loathsome prologue-writing and novel-revising job which stares me in the face when I get home. Then more reading and absorption—and then we shall see. I may eventually send Pharnabogus the *Doorstep*, but I don't want the effect of a rejection just now. He is wholly commercial in his outlook—as witness his complaints against my "long" stories when he publishes gallons of utter drivel .... vast long serials .... by his trashy favourites. At a later period I may have more patience with that kind of thing—but just now my nerves are not in the right shape to confront it. This is the season for me to *absorb* impressions—not put them forth. I'm still revelling in the discovery of William Hope Hodgson—which, as I told you, I owe to the always-accommodating Koenig. Well—we shall see what we shall see. It's curious how the rejection of *At the Mountains of Madness* slowed up my whole writing career. I was the better for a pause between 1908 and 1917, and may be better for one between 1933 and gawd knows when! The more I stand off as a critical non-participant, the more avoidable faults I see in my stuff. I shall always make mistakes and perpetrate crudities, but certain specific types of error are not likely to reappear.

Sam Perkins is certainly a great boy—he'll doubtless be a full-fledged K.A.T. member by the time you and Jug get around—although he's git himself in bad with Pres. Randall and Vice-Pres. Osterberg by offering to fight them! I have apologised on his behalf to the old fellows, and they've promised not to blackball him when his name comes up. The brashness of youth must be excused! In Boston I encountered another likely sprig—at my host's home—who can give Sam a run for his money. This young gentleman is named Peter Ivan. and is a tiger angora of just about Sam's age. What a boy! He tears about continually, climbs up and down everybody, and then curls up to sleep in an ornamental basket which he chose and appropriated without asking anybody's permission. Like Sam, he shows fight toward his elders—the elders in question being my host's other two felidae—Napoleon and the Duke of Wellington. Peter was in my lap or around my feet during the bulk of my visit. Here in Nantucket my greatest friends are three coal-black and precisely identical brothers at the restaurant where I eat. They were born last spring, and their perfect blackness and utter similarity caused them all to be retained. One is especially friendly—and jumps in my lap as I eat. He would like to ascend another stage and participate in the repast, but I discourage him from that procedure—preferring to treat him to select morsels where he is.

Peace of Allah upon thee—
