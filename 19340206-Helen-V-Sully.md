Dear Helen:—

..................... Thanksgiving I did something I have been wanting to do all my life—consumed the traditional feast on this historic soil of ancient *Plymouth* (less than 40 miles from here), where the whole custom started 312 years ago. The day was miraculously warm—up to 68º in the afternoon—& I spent it all in the venerable Pilgrim town, going over all the familiar sights & unearthing many new ones. I will enclose a couple of cards illustrating the pilgrimage. Plymouth has an atmosphere all its own, & its extreme age never ceases to arouse reflection. In what a wilderness did it take root in 1620! There was then nothing north of it save the straggling town of Quebec on & under its beetling cliff, the lesser hamlets of Tadoussac on the St. Lawrence & Port Royal in Acadia, & the fortress & trading-post of Pentagoët in what is now Maine. West & south only the mysterious black woods with their unknown savages till the tiny Dutch trading post (not yet the town of New-Amsterdam) on Manhattan Island was reached. Then the wilderness again down to the banks of the James—where lay the nearest settlement of our own people—the dominion of Virginia, only 13 years old. Below that another stretch with only the moss-grown foundation-walls of ruined Huguenot houses along salt inlets till one cam to the frowning walls of Spanish San Augustin ..... 55 years old, & having many houses which still survive in this year of 1934. A new & unspoiled world—& look at the mess its later inhabitants have made of it!

................. Your early glimpse of the now famous Ruth Slenznki (however it's spelt) is certainly vastly interesting to look back upon. Such a Spartan regimen as that imposed upon her seems barbarous & pathetic even in view of the present
brilliant results. Surely, musical genius is not so frail & uncertain a thing that it must needs be forced in infancy at the expense of normal childhood enjoyment & leisure. It seems to me that a slower training, with rational vacational intervals, would have produced just as much in the end, even though such early proficiency might not have been attained. But of course one can’t be positive about such matters. I certainly hope I shall have an opportunity to hear her at her present stage—though of course my unmusical ear would be deaf to much of the subtle & unique charm of the rendition. As coincidence would have it, one of my correspondents has lately heard her playing for the first time—over the radio—& writes in the same mood of astonished enthusiasm which seems to have characterised both yourself & the newspaper critics. Unspoiled youth—sincere & free from self-consciousness & acquired mannerisms—certainly has am vast advantage over jaded maturity in the practice of any art; but music is the only form of expression which can be fully mastered while the mind is still unspoiled. It would be assuming a good deal gratuitously to say that such examples of childhood beauty-creation argue the existence of a "higher power," but we surely must marvel at the rare cases in which a discriminating sensitiveness to harmonic rhythms & basic human moods develops instinctively in very early life. Of course, all genius is very largely a matter of unusual natural development, whether it occur early or late. Mere talent can indeed be sharpened by hard work; but the poignant & special aptitude which goes beyond mere talent & draws on the subconscious is a biological, innate matter. It can't be governed from outside, & we are unable to formulate any set of laws to explain or measure it, Its very essence is irregularity.

Abruptly descending in the scale of values—I doubt very much whether music could have been my primary mode of expression. Possibly I would not have reacted so violently against its higher manifestations if my childhood lessons had been less academic, & on a more elementary instrument, yet after all no real musician could ever have been scared off as I was. Moreover—if I had any innate taste I would not enjoy cheap tunes .... as I frankly & unashamedly do. I can understand a thwarted musician's caring for *no* melodies at all—but I can hardly picture him with a gang of fellows whistling or howling the tin pan ditties of the period with overt & genuine gusto, as Grandpa E’ch-Pi-El must confess to having done in the lost golden days of '06 & thereabouts! It took the bizarre & nondescript tonal & rhythmical hashes of post-war jazz to get me disgusted with popular ballads—& even now I relish the old-time inanities when they are revived on the *radio* .... though this may be merely because they recall the lost illusions & optimisms of the youthful period when I first knew & ululated them.

Regarding *The Hill of Dreams*—I could almost guarantee that your second perusal will reveal subtleties of beauty & pathos which the first juvenile skimming left hidden. Of course any such cerebral & emotional history drags at times—but the whole thing is a tremendously poignant chronicle of aesthetic sensitiveness & the desperate struggle for adequate expression. No one who has reacted strongly to the beauty & mystery of the external world, & then failed utterly to capture his profound, complex, many-unnamed, & mistily-outlined impression in the words or pigments or tones of his chosen medium, can fail to see himself potently mirrored in many aspects of Lucian Taylor's life & character. Early in the novel the crux of the matter is summed up in plain words:

*He wrote & planned & filled the waste-paper basket with hopeless efforts....... There was enough of difficulty to appal; from following the intricate course of little nameless brooks, from hushed twilight woods, from the vision of the mountains, & the breath of the great wind, passing from deep to deep, he would come home filled with thoughts & emotions, mystic fancies which he yearned to translate into the written word. And the result of the effort seemed always to be bathos! Wooden sentences, a portentous, stilted style, obscurity, & awkwardness clogged his pen; it seemed impossible to win the great secret of language; the stars glittered only in the darkness, & vanished away in clearer light. The periods of despair were often long & heavy, the victories very few & trifling; night after night be sat writing after his father had knocked out his last pipe, filling a page with difficulty in an hour, & usually forced to thrust the stuff away in despair, & go unhappily to bed, conscious that after all his labour he had done nothing. And there were moments when the accustomed vision of the land alarmed him, & the wild domed hills & darkling woods seemed symbols of some terrible secret in the inner life of that stranger—himself.*

Ever since reading this book—in 1923—I have longed to see the strange & haunted region—Caerleon-on-Usk, the ancient Isca Silurum of the Second Augustan Legion in Roman days—which it reflects, & which was the boyhood environment of Arthur Machen. Just recently I secured Weigall's *Wanderings in Roman Britain*, & therein found all my tantalising impressions confirmed. It appears that within the last decade the long-buried Caerleon amphitheatre has been unearthed—& found to be in almost perfect condition after its long centuries of oblivion. The Second Legion was at Isca from 78 to 368 A. D.—it then being transferred to the east coast to guard against the ever-increasing menace of the Saxons. Weigall's book makes Lucian's Roman dream-life (H. of D. Ch. IV) stand out with doubled vividness.
