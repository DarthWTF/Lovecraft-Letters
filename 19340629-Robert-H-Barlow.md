Home in old CHARLESTON  
June 29, 1934

Hail, Lord Ghu:—

..... Had some good luck at the Y—I blew into Charleston at 3 a.m., and meant to wait out the night without paying an hotel bill; but the generous old night clerk let me have *free*, for the residue of the night, the room I had engaged for the *next* night! I hadn't expected that—but the joke is that, for me, this gives 2 *full* nights for the price of one; since I wouldn't have hit the hay till 3 a.m. or so anyhow! Will leave Charleston with about $23.00 or just under—not so bad, considering. Still on 20¢ a day for food, but off the canned stuff. Morning—5¢ cup of ice cream. Evening, 10¢ bowl of Mexican chili and another 5¢ cup of ice cream. .....

Regards to all.  
Yr. obt. Grandsire, HPL
