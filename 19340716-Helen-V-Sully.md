Dear Helen:—

......................... Regarding the sombre reflections of last month—I trust that your present trip, with its constant sequence of external objects of interest & its vivid variety of impressive, mankind-dwarfing landscapes, has done much to dispel them & to relegate their bases to a suitably insignificant place in the background. There is nothing like a combination of engrossing impressions & awesome natural scenery to restore one's sense of harmony & proportion. After all, nothing really matters in the ceaseless round of the limitless cosmos—a cosmos amidst which man & all organic life form only the most trivial incident—except in the most local way; & this local teleology can hardly go beyond the reasonably harmonic adjustment of the individual to the forces within & behind him .... a state best achieved through a realistic facing of the conditions of existence, with all their inevitable frustrations & shortcomings, & a philosophic determination *not to expect more than its mediocre pittance of contentment which the cosmos actually has to offer*. Once we cease to maintain the extravagant & often grotesque demands upon life which ill-founded mythologies & ridiculous conventions of sentimentality have unfortunately taught us to maintain, we achieve a degree of resigned tranquility amidst which we are free to busy ourselves with the infinite array of interesting things in the external world—the intrinsic beauty of nature & art, the drama of history & change, the stimulating play of intellect & imagination, & so on! And with these things at our disposal, we generally find (except when oppressed by unusual handicaps such as extreme poverty) that the process of being conscious brings enough rewards to repay us for the trouble of maintaining it. Some, indeed, are probably fortunate enough to derive even *more* pleasure from existence than they would from oblivion. Roughly speaking, I'd tend to say that of all the human race about half are just as well off alive as they would be dead. Another quarter would be better off dead, while the remaining quarter are distinctly better off alive than they would be dead. In general, the more interested in things *outside himself* a person is, the better time he is likely to have in the world. When anybody becomes introspective—constantly watching himself & his emotions, & constantly worrying about the exact emotions of other people towards him—he is almost certain to become utterly miserable .... & useless to the community, to boot. That is really one of the best defined forms of what we may call *decadence*. It is associated with the spineless & lethargic old age of the race or culture, & crops out continually in the literature & the arts of a feeble or moribund group. There is altogether too much of this decadent introspectiveness in the art & thought of the present western world to make well-wishers of that world feel comfortable—although it is rather debatable just what, specifically, to do about it. I can sympathise with the basic wish of those intertwined with systems—like German Nazism—which try to discourage the the neurotic art & literature of introspection & to foster in its place the healthy, extraverted, objective art which characterised our civilisation in its youth. It may be that such efforts to guide art are futile, since the well-springs of art are so deep & so bound up with historic conditions hard to change. Certainly, some of them are tremendously ridiculous & disastrously anti-cultural. But just the same one can understand why vital national regenerators like Mussolini or Hitler or Mustapha Kemal or Stalin try their hardest to promote an aesthetic atmosphere favourable to active objective life, contented social adjustment, & the healthy relative selflessness which encourages group enthusiasm, stamina, & progress toward a given collective end. The greatness of nations, like the happiness of individuals, undoubtably rests on an *objective* habit of mind & emotions.

Concerning the relative merits of epistolary & personally present acquaintances—I fancy it is all a matter of individual temperament. Some people have a psychology which best fits them for first-hand social contacts; while others find that too much gregariousness brings out more of irritation than of interest, hence prefer to limit their contacts to that impersonal exchange of ideas which long-distance correspondence provides, Actually, human beings differ far more than is commonly assumed; so that many things which we popularly regard as simple & universal are in truth highly complex & infinitely varied. This is especially true of the motives & emotions lying behind human relations & acquaintanceship. Unintelligent tradition postulates some single mystical force called "friendship", & weaves a whole cycle of sentimental myth around it & its supposed properties; whereas in truth there is no such *one* thing—almost every separate case of human acquaintance & liking being due to some separate & individual combination of many dissimilar elements. If one takes any two cases of acquaintance or liking or mutual interest at random, the chances are that the motives & emotions behind each are totally dissimilar if not utterly antipodal. Only the *external* aspect—the fact that *some* sort of congeniality results—is similar, yet from that deceptive similarity any number of absurd folklore generalisations are made. For the most part, friendship is a device to magnify the ego. People seek others to serve as a sort of flattering mirror or sounding-board, so that they may appear enhanced in their own eyes. The average person acquires a sense of inferiority unless he has an audience to encourage & applaud him—hence much of the gregariousness of mankind. Other causes of human acquaintanceship are more primitive—an instinctive fear of solitude inherited from days when race-survival depended upon a massed defence against enemies, or a diffusive extension of such specialised instincts are the parental, filial, or amative. Still other causes are connected with imaginative inadequacy—a person is so lacking in resourcefulness that he does not know what to do except when supplied with the external suggestions & coöperation of others. Ascending in the scale of intelligence, we find another & wholly distinct source of friendship in the intrinsic pleasure of exchanging ideas & impressions with others capable of understanding & parallelling them. This last is closely connected with the general creative impulse behind art & scholarship, whereby the individual feels a wish to formulate & transmit the impressions & experiences he receives. And so on, & so on—not counting the spurious forms of friendship, whose emotions are purely mercenary or otherwise concerned with direct material advantage, although those are tremendously prevalent. Well—although every separate instance of personal acquaintance usually involves (at least to some extent) *more than one* of these distinct elements, it is probably a fact that in each case some one element does very largely predominate. And it is very natural that some persons should prefer acquaintanceships of one sort, whilst others should prefer other sorts. The more analytical the individual, the more decided will be his preferences—since the undiscriminating person is flattered when anybody notices him for *any* reason, & weaves his own self-complacent interpretation for his own benefit. The least discriminating persons are the best "mixers"—the likeliest to find congenial friends everywhere in large quantities. Their own motives for acquaintanceship probably centre in imaginative inadequacy—the need for external suggestion—& egotism, joined to a powerful nucleus of instinctive gregariousness & solutide-fear. It is easy to satisfy them. They are not quickly alienated by dulness, overbearingness, or overdemonstrableness in others, & they empathetically prefer personal acquaintance to correspondence. The latter, indeed, since it involves only the idea-exchanging element, is of little or no interest to most of them. At the opposite pole stands the person whose discrimination is very keen, & whose taste in acquaintanceship is limited to certain kinds. He, obviously, cannot find congenial acquaintances as readily as his gregarious brother. There are only certain sorts of persons to whom he has anything to say, & who can say anything which will interest him. Those who force uncongenial forms of acquaintanceship on him qualify as a nuisance. Just where he will find the right kinds of friends—whether in person or in correspondence—depends on just what kind he is looking for. In the case of one whose object is primarily *the exchange of ideas & impressions*, the chances are that he will most readily find kindred spirits in correspondence; since what people put into their correspondence is generally ideas & impressions. Not that he couldn't eventually find such spirits in person—for there *are* many individuals whose chief interest (in conversation as well as correspondence) is the exchange of ideas—but that he can find them *quickest & most unonerously* by letter; since a vast lot of people deal principally with ideas *when writing*, yet turn largely to other elements when in face-to-face company. (Thus many are splendid correspondents, yet dull or overbearing as personal companions.) Regarding your own case—I fancy you belong essentially in the category who look mainly for idea- exchanging acquaintanceships, & who rather dislike those founded on other elements. This, naturally, makes it harder for you to find suitable friends than as if you were less discriminating; & it also explains why you find & retain epistolary friends more readily than those of the face-to-face sort. The condition is not to be wondered at, & is probably shared by many more persons than you realise. I suppose this discriminating fastidiousness loses one a certain amount of simple gregarious pleasure which more callous persons enjoy, yet I am not at all certain that it is to be wholly regretted. Probably the rewards of intelligent idea-exchange with the few persons whom a discriminating individual *does* care to know, are measurably greater than the rewards which the bluff "mixer" derives from his wide array of heterogeneous & unselective contacts. The thing to do is merely to jog along quietly & self-sufficiently; seizing opportunities for congenial idea-exchange whenever they present themselves—either epistolarily or conversationally—& not worrying if only a few of the contacts thus established prove worthy of permanent retention. A solid, choice circle of a few friends is every inch as good as a crowd. In the course of time the number of really congenial friends acquired is bound to increase. perhaps a majority of them will be epistolary—especially since letters give on a world-wide radius to select from, whereas face-to-face acquaintanceship is confined to the comparatively small population of an established geographical area—but a few personal ones will be bound to develop. And you have plenty of time to let nature take its course in the matter—for the very best of friends are those whom one acquires in full maturity, when one's mind & tastes are thoroughly crystallised & conscious of what they want. I myself—with whom idea- exchange is also the only major basis of acquaintanceship—have found this to be very emphatically true. Virtually all my "social" life is that of correspondence, since the local associates of my youth have dropped completely out of my circle of interests & assumed the status of merely nodding acquaintances. Today I don't really know anybody in Providence—& of the various people I do know .... Belknap, Klarkash-Ton, Young Melmoth, Barlow, Morton, Price, & so on ...... the great majority did not appear on my horizon till I was much older than you are. I never heard of Belknap till I was 29 & never exchanged a word with Klarkash-Ton till I was 32! All these friends have come very slowly & gradually—they are the minority who have stuck in the sieve through which scores of casual acquaintances have passed to unknown realms beyond. And that, I fancy, is the way all really congenial & enduring circles of friends are built up. Not merely a matter of years, but a matter of decades.
