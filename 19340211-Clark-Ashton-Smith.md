At the Monolith on the Mound—  
Hour that the Dogs Howl  
Feb. 11, 1934

Dear Klarkash-Ton:—

...........  
That Weigall book—to the thorough reading of which I couldn't get around till a couple of weeks ago—was a veritable treasure-house of data anent a Britain whose life and splendours most have forgotten. As fascinated as I have always been by Roman Britain (one of my greatest controversies of 20 years ago was with a chap who claimed that Roman civilisation and the Latin language never had any foothold in Brtain outside the camps and large towns—gad, but I wish I'd had Weigall to quote then!), I never before realised how utterly and stably Roman a province it was, and how many tangible reliques still survive from the past. Think of arches and walls and towers still surviving. *which were a thousand years old when William the Conqueror landed*! Of course such things are scattered, and in some cases only lately exhumed—or distinguished from mediaeval masonry—but they are there! The description of the Arthur Machen country—Caerleon-on-Usk is fascinating. That amphitheatre described in the Roman dream chapter of *The Hill of Dreams* has been dug out of its covering mound during the last decade, and now stands almost as it was when built by the Second Augustan Legion under Sextus Julius Frontinus in A. D. 78—before the destruction of Pompeii in the home land. Its condition is so perfect that it probably forms the finest Roman amphitheatre now existing—in better shape than the Colosseum, though of course not even comparable in size. ....................

I was extremely fascinated by your description of your feline colleagues, and wish that I might see pictures of the nighted and saturnine Simaetha and the bluff and bellicose Genl. Tabasco. Simaetha would surely seem to be a true heir to the most sorcerous traditions of Hyperborea and Regio Averonum—not unlike those reputedly immortal felines who guarded the shrine of Sadoqua, and whose regular disappearances at New Moon figure so largely in the folklore of mediaeval Averoigne. One recalls the disquieting suggestions in Jehan d'Arbois' *Roman des Sorciers* concerning the huge black cats captured at those very singular Sabbats on the rocky hill behind Vyones—the cats which could not be burned, but which escaped unhurt from the flames, uttering cries which, though not like any known human speech, were damnably close to the unknown syllables forming part of the Tsath-ritual in the Livre d’Eibon. Here on the ancient hill, as I may have mentioned, I am in close touch with the secret and portentous Kappa Alpha Tau (Κομψῶν ᾿Αἰλούρων Τάξις) fraternity which meets on the roof of a shed across the garden beneath my west window. The president, Peter Randall, is an elderly black and white gentleman of aristocratic and sacerdotal descent, who inherits the darkest arcana of Bubastis and Meroë. Like me, he’s no lover of cold weather, but appears at the club only when climatic conditions are favourable. His aloofness from ordinary mortals both human and feline is proverbial, but he has at last permitted me to break through his reserve, so that he now even
rolls over in an undignified and kittenish fashion when he sees Grandpa E’ch-Pi-El approaching. The Vice-President, Count Magnus Osterberg (belonging to a Scandinavian household in Waterman Street), is a huge and handsome tiger with a white face and gloves and boots, whose aristocratic reserve is quite equal to Pres. Randall's. He and Peter are very close friends, but neither ever pays the slightest attention to any other feline. When one is out alone, he always looks about for the other; and when they have found each other they generally take up permanent stations about two feet apart—dozing, surveying the semi-rural scenery of their back-garden oasis, or exchanging courteous and affable glances. Casual approaches of other cats are unheeded, but when any outside Grimalkin becomes actually obtrusive and overbearing (no cat of K. A. T. calibre *would* become so!), Count Magnus displays the hardier side of his nature. (Pres. Randall has outlived his combative years, hence repels foes only with chilling glances.) Magnus never picks a fight, and often goes to considerable lengths of tact to avert a vulgar brawl—but when the other guy becomes insistent, so that a gentleman must either fight or bear the imputation of tarnished honour, then just watch the scion of the ancient Osterberg line! All the hardy blood of generations of Norrland jarls, and all the cryptic lore learnt from the Lapps and Finnish warlocks, then comes to the fore—and the fur that flies during the ensuing moments is not often the tiger-and-white miniver of Count Magnus Osterberg! Just as I have never seen Count Magnus provoke or invite a combat, so have I never seen him retreat. A true gentleman and Nordic nobleman, by Gad! Both Pres. Randall and Vice Pres. Osterberg have their favourite spots for taking the air—the President favouring the clubhouse roof (which is in his yard) and Count Magnus his own back fence, slightly to the north. Each, however, is very courteous about transferring the seat of a colloquy to the other's chosen territory. As for the others—the secretary is a large Maltese, recently elected to replace a grey part-Angora who has withdrawn from the fraternity. The Treasurer—Stephen Randall, who looks enough like Peter to be his son, though he has no white spot on the end of his tail—is also newly chosen, supplanting a small tiger who resigned. Other members are a titanic coal-black warrior with a stentorian voice, a pale yellow gentleman of fairly martial tastes, an exceedingly handsome double-pawed tortoise-shell, and a large, pale tiger—tolerated more or less on probation. When four or five are assembled on the clubhouse roof beneath my window, the effect is the most companionable kind of thing imaginable. Count Magnus, moreover, sometimes honours this household with a visit. Of other local felidae—non-members of the Kappa Alpha Tau—one may mention the white and black huntress at the boarding-house across the back garden, who is my aunt's especial favourite, Last summer, after some of her own kittens were eliminated by the local Nazi committee which decided they didn’t come up to the best Aryan standard, she adopted two exquisite little tigers with unopened eyes from some unknown source and proceeded to rear them with scientific solicitude. One was later given away to appreciative owners, but the other (an utterly fascinating and incredibly companionable little rascal) became my most frequent visitor and constant playmate. Because of his sprightly, insolent precocity I called him *Alfred Galpin* after our iconoclastic young friend .... and how he did climb over my desk and chair and shoulders and all the surrounding points
of vantage ..... threading his way over tables and among ornaments without ever breaking a thing! But alas! One sad day in mid-December he failed to appear in his wonted haunts, and he has never since been seen. All mourn his absence—and try to picture him as the recipient of some kindly rather than tragic fate. Perhaps he skipped and sidled toward one of our glorious hillside sunsets and passed into the fourth dimension, there to remain as an acolyte of the panther-god Hra in the City of Never, always as young as on the day he came. But it was a blow to the K. A. T. to lose so promising a future member. Count Magnus has vowed vengeance upon any Entity responsible for the disappearance!
