Dear Mr. Baldwin:-

.... I'd like to see the Northwest some time-not only Idaho but the coast. When I was a small boy I read the juvenile novel *Rick Dale*, by Kirk Munroe(a boys' author almost forgotten now), & some of the most interesting parts dealt with Seattle & Puget Sound-then barely past the boom or late-pioneering stage. The region seemed very fascinating to me, & I longed for visit it. Seattle was also mentioned very often in Munroe's Alaskan stories-*The Fur Seal's Tooth & Snow Shoes & Sledges*. Alaska also a captivated my imagination-all the more so because my constitution could never endure cold (I can't go out when it's under 20º). The idea of people actually keeping alive in the arctic region of the Yukon seemed so strange to me that the whole subject of Alaska took on the overtones of mystery and glamour in my mind. I hope you'll be able to get in on some of the exotic expeditions which beckon you, If I were more used to roughing it, I'd like to participate in some archeological venture in Africa, Central America, or the Amazon Valley. I am especially fitted for the tropics, since I don’t know what it is to feel too warm. ....

As for myself—I was born on August 20, 1890, about a mile east of where I live now. My home was then near the edge of the thickly. built district, so that my childish memories cling round rural scenes—fields, woods, farms, brooks, ravines, & the broad Seekonk River with its high wooded banks—as much as they do around urban scenes. The
houses in that part of town were only about 30 years old or less, but I used to be fascinated by the ancient houses in the hill section where I now live. Old things always impressed me—& when I discovered the very ancient books of the family library in a dark attic room, I read them more than any others. That is how I came to be so familiar with the different sorts of old-fashioned typography. Everything mysterious & fantastic also impressed me—I loved to hear fairy-tales & ghost & witch stories—which latter my grandfather used to tell me. When I began to read at the age of 4, Grimm's *Fairy Tales* & the *Arabian Nights* were among the first things I seized on. Later I came across simple books about Greek & Roman mythology, & was still more fascinated by them. When I was 8, I began to take an interest in science—first chemistry (I had a small laboratory in the cellar) & later geography, astronomy, & other subjects—but my liking for myths & mystery never decreased. I first tried writing at 6, & the earliest story I can remember was written at 7—something about a cave of robbers called *The Noble Eavesdropper*. At 8 1 wrote many crude tales (rightfully crude!), two of which—*The Mysterious Ship & The Secret of the Grave* I still have. I also wrote reams of verse, the rules for which I learned from an old book published in 1797. My style in both prose & verse was very old-fashioned, for I always felt a strange kinship with the 18th century—the age of the old books & the old houses I loved. I also felt a strong affinity for ancient Rome. All this time I had a very free hand in choosing my pursuits, since ill health kept me from school much of the time. I had many nervous breakdowns, & in the end was unable to attend college—indeed, my health was never any good till I was 30 years old. I was about 8 or 9 when I first got hold of Poe & adopted him as a model. Virtually all my tales were weird—for nothing has ever fascinated me half so much as the mystery of time & space & the unknown ... though I have not believed in religion or any form of the supernatural since I was 8. Remote and inaccessible places like the antarctic & other worlds enthralled my imagination. Astronomy in particular attracted me—I had (& still have) a good small telescope, & when 13 began to edit & publish a little astronomical magazine—*The R. I. Journal of Astronomy*—on a hectograph. When I was 16, & in high school, I broke into print for the first time—with a monthly article on astronomical phenomena in a newly-founded local daily, & with other astronomical articles in the rural press. At 18 I became dis- satisfied with all my fiction, & destroyed most of the tales 1 had written. About that time I turned exclusively to verse, essays, & criticism, & did not write another tale for 9 years. My health was so poor that I led a very inactive life—travelling not at all, & being quite a hermit—though I always managed to get out to the country (mostly on a bicycle) on fine summer afternoons. In 1914 I joined one of the nationwide amateur press associations which are so helpful to isolated literary beginners, & was brought into contact with many capable writers who helped to check certain oddities in my style & to redirect my attention to the weird fiction which must always constitute my major form of self-expression. 1 began my new series of weird tales in 1917—with *The Tomb & Dagon*. In 1918 I wrote *Polaris*, & in 1919 *Beyond the Wall of Sleep*. There was then no thought of *professionally* publishing these things, though a few appeared in the amateur press. Late in 1919 I first encountered the work of Dunsany, which influenced me profoundly & awaked me to a period of intensive production never paralleled before or since. In 1923 the discovery of Arthur Machen further stimulated my imagination. Meanwhile—after 1920—my health began very gradually to improve. I became less of a hermit, tried my hand at travelling (New Hampshire 1921, New York & Cleveland 1922), & began the intensive exploration of other old towns than Providence. (Salem, Marblehead, &c—which became reflected in my tales as "Ark-
ham" & "Kingsport".) In 1922 I first had a story professionally published—in a small magazine called *Home Brew*, edited by one of the amateur press association members. This was the very poor *Herbert West—Reanimator*—a series of six separate episodes presented in instalments. Later that year the same magazine published my *Lurking Fear* (afterward reprinted by *W. T.*) as a 4-part serial with illustrations by
Clark Ashton Smith—whom I had also met through the amateur association. In 1923 *W. T.* was founded, & at Smith's urging I sent in 7 stories for consideration, All were accepted—Edwin Baird, more favourable to me than Wright, then being editor—& publication began in October with *Dagon*. From then on I have been having things in *W. T.* I soon encouraged my young friend Frank B. Long (also met in amateur journalism) to contribute—his first tale appearing late in 1924, About this time my increasing health caused me to branch out in the world more than formerly—even to the point of attempting residence in New York, where most of my friends happen to be—but this programme did not prove satisfactory. 1 grew to hate the metropolis—& in 1926 returned home for good. However, my travelling proclivities continued, & I have been constantly pushing my limits of exploration both north & south, In 1924 I reached Philadelphia; in 1925 Washington & northern Virginia; in 1927 Portland, Maine & southern Vermont; in 1928 more of Vermont, the Mohawk Trail, Albany, Baltimore, Annapolis, Washington again, & the Endless Caverns in western Virginia (my first glimpse of the marvellous underground world); in 1929 Kingston & other historic N. Y. spots, Richmond, Williamsburg, Jamestown, & Yorktown in Virginia; in 1930 Charleston on the south & Quebec on the north; in 1931 the whole of Florida, even Key West; & in 1932 Chattanooga, Memphis, Vicksburg, Natchez, New Orleans, & Mobile, Declining finances—now rather desperate—have curtailed my travels. When I had the money I hadn’t the health, & now that I have the health I haven't the money. Only cheap 'bus & excursion rates now enable me to get around as I do. Literary revision—which I do in addition to original writing (the late Houdini was among my clients)—has all gone to hell, Unusual events are very rare with me—slow shrinkage being the general rule of life. My family has now shrunk to one aunt & myself, & last May we combined households in this ancient backwater which belongs to the college & has a very cheap rental despite its good location, comfortable spaciousness, & admirable steam heat & hot water. I have always wanted to live in an old house, but never succeeded till poverty drove me to this one! I have become extremely fond of the place—whose size has enabled us to get a good many old family things—furniture, paintings, statuary, &c—out of storage, It seems, in some ways, tremendously like the old home on a small scale. I believe I mentioned that my own personal quarters consist of a library & a bedroom—my desk being at a west window with a fine view of old roofs & gardens, distant spires & towers, & the glamorous sunset beyond. My library contains about 2,000 volumes, though I have catalogued only the weird section of it. My favourite authors—aside from the Graeco-Roman classics & the English poets & essayists of the 18th century—are Poe, Dunsany, Machen, Blackwood, M. R. James, Walter de la Mare, & others of that type. Apart from phantasy, I prefer realism in fiction—Balzac, Flaubert, de Maupassant, Zola, Proust, &c. I think the French are better adapted than we to the reflection of life as a whole—our Anglo-Saxon specialty being poetry. I dislike nearly all Victorian literature, & believe that such very recent material as escapes freakishness has more promise than most of the stuff immediately preceding it. Ultra-modernism I regard as mainly a blind alley, though it may contribute isolated elements to the mainstream. I like conservatism in style, & think recent prose tends to be slipshod & inartistic. In music my taste is very poor—probably as a result of violin lessons forced on me when I was too young—& very rapidly forgotten. I am a frank barbarian, with Victor Herbert as about the upper limit of my teal appreciation. In painting my taste is conservative, with landscapes as my favourite subjects. I wish I could draw & paint—as many of my family have done—but I can't. In architecture I hate functional modernism as a bull is supposed to hate a red rag. The classical is my first choice, though I poignantly appreciate a really soaring specimen of Gothic. All told, it is possible that science, history, & philosophy interest me more than aesthetics. Politically I used to be a reactionary—royalist & federalist—but recent realistic thought has switched me to an almost opposite pole of economic liberalism—government ownership, artificially allocated work, fixed schedules of pay & hours, unemployment insurance, old-age pensions, & so on, But I don't think the people can ever govern themselves. Reforms will have to come through a fascistic rule of the trained few unless they are to peter out in a mess. I am all for the preservation of the main cultural tradition, & have no use at all for radical upheavals like Russian bolshevism. Philosophically I am a mechanistic materialist like George Santayana I am greatly interested in the mystery of early man—archeology, anthropology, &c., & am a born antiquarian in every way. Perhaps my most persistent interest is the imaginative recapture of America’s 18th century past. Roman history also engrosses me. I can’t think of the ancient world except from a Roman point of view, & am especially fascinated by *Roman Britain* (as Arthur Machen is), where the Roman cultural stream meets the stream of my personal ancestry. I shall yet use Roman Britain in fiction—though I don’t know just how. I dislike to see great cultural fabrics split up, & am a sincere Tory in my regret for America’s separation from the British Empire. I think the differences of 1775 ought to have been settled within the empire. I admire Mussolini, but think Hitler is a very inferior copy—led astray by romantic conceptions & pseudo-science. At that, though, Hitler may have formed a necessary evil—saving his country from disintegration. In general, I think any nation ought to keep close to its original dominant race-stock—remaining largely Nordic if it started that way; largely Latin if it started that way, & so on. Only in this manner can comfortable cultural homogeneity & continuity be secured. But Hitler's extremes of pure racialism are absurd & grotesque. Various race-stocks differ in inclinations & aptitudes, but of all of them I consider only the negro & australoid biologically inferior. Against these two a rigid colour-line ought to exist. As for my own stuff & literary methods & views—I have outlined these things in former letters, leaving very little to be supplied in the portrait of myself. In casual matters, an utter indifference to games & sports of every kind may be noted. My chief pleasure is seeing old houses & wandering about ancient & picturesque landscapes on summer days. I’m never under a roof in summer if the weather permits
—but always take my work & reading in a bag & make for the woods & fields. I love heat & can’t stand the cold—so that ] may have to move south some day despite my intense attachment to my native scenery & atmosphere. Walking is my only form of real exercise—& in this pursuit T have developed an almost unlimited endurance in recent years. I prefer only 2 meals a day, on a flexible schedule. I usually work best at night. I abhor all sea food with a tremendous & inexplicable violence, & dote on cheese, chocolate, & ice cream. I don’t care for tobacco & have never tasted intoxicating liquor. In general, I prefer an Apollonian to a Dionysian attitude. I have an inordinate fondness for *cats* of every shape & kind, including the toughest & most battered old Thomas-warriors. In aspect I am 5 ft. 11 in. tall, weight vacillating on either side of 145, very light complexion, brown eyes, brown hair turning iron grey, stoop shoulders, & a phiz as ugly as hell with elongated proboscis & lantern jaw. Plain & conservative in attire, & unobtrusive & retiring in manner except when I get started on an argumentative conversation. Argument—either oral or epistolary—is something I can't resist.

..... Mastering Greek after 40 is a feat to be proud of—I haven't been able to retain much of the little I got when I was 16 & 17! There used to be a polyglot testament—Latin, Greek, & English—in our old dark attic, but I let it go during one of the later upheavals. Now I'm almost sorry that I did—indeed, I always regret it when I let a book go. .... My ancestry is shy on writers—unless some of the clergymen (all in England) listed on my charts published Sermons or other stuff that I know nothing about. The things I keep for family interest are the paintings by my mother (d. 1921) & elder aunt (d. 1932), which really have marked artistic merit (especially my late aunt's) in addition to their associational value to me. Many were hopelessly spoilt in storage, but some were never stored & others have been successfully touched up & repaired. A great marine view by my aunt now hangs in the large space over the staircase. I also have a very old crayon drawing by my grandmother, & may possibly inherit a painting by a great-aunt later on. It would be much more convenient if my reliques of family talent were compact books instead of large canvases—but I try to hang on to everything as long as I can. I don't care to live at all—& don't intend to—unless I can keep a reasonable number of my accustomed things around me—the tables, chairs, bookcases, pictures, books, & ornaments which I have known all my life, & which have stayed on through five removals. These things spell *home* to me, & I would not know what to do without them. ..... Yrs. most sincerely,  
H.P. Lovecraft
